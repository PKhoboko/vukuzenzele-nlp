# Dockerfile for testing sentence_alignemt

## Background

The LASER module requires a specific runtime env in order to install all the packages required by it. That enviroment is Ubuntu 20.04(.5) and Python 3.8(.10). 

If you do not feel like spending day's trying to get your computer to adhere to those standards, you can try out this docker file. 

**Be warned - I coded this dockerfile but it still gives me errors when trying to install the laser packages.**

The issue is with a package named `fairseq`. 
We need `fairseq==0.12.1` but there is something or other about `version.txt` missing.
It was documented in this [Github thread](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq/issues/4501).   
The resolution was a version upgrade to `fairseq==0.12.2` but that causes a different error when trying to perform the embeddings. The new error was documented in this [Stackoverflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74740896/fairseq-generate-giving-me-the-error-runtimeerror-mask-type-should-be-defined).  
The resolution is to downgrade to `fairseq==0.12.1` 

Have fun!
