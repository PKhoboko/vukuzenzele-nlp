Over the course of the three years, since the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture started its work, we have heard of the lengths to which the perpetrators of corrupt acts have gone to conceal their misdeeds.
It has been an extremely complex undertaking to unravel the networks of influence that enabled corruption. Among other things, vast webs of front companies were established to move funds around and disguise payments made to politically-connected individuals.The same patterns have been seen in a number of investigations into cor-ruption being undertaken by the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) the Directorate for Priority Crime Inves-tigation, the National Prosecuting Authority's (NPA) Investigating Direc-torate and others.As these investigations progressed and the net began to close on implicated individuals, we have seen witnesses being threatened, their families intimidated, being forced into hiding, and even killed.The murder of Babita Deokaran, a senior finance official in the Gauteng health department, is a stark reminder of the high stakes involved in our collective quest to remove this cancer from our society.While we do not yet know the motive for her murder, she was a key witness in a SIU investigation into the procurement of personal protective equipment in the department.The SAPS and the private security teams who appre-hended seven suspects recently are to be com-mended for their work. The docket has been transferred to the Hawks, and the inves-tigation will yield further information on why Ms Deokaran was murdered.Regardless of the circum-stances behind this tragedy, Ms Deokaran was a hero and a patriot. As are the legions of whistleblowers who, at great risk to them-selves, help to unearth instances of misdeeds, mal-administration, cronyism and theft.Without their brave and principled interventions,  we would be unable to unmask those committing corruption. Though much focus in recent times has been on whistleblowers in the public sector, we also owe a debt of gratitude to those in the private sector whose actions receive less attention, but are equally important.Whistleblowers are important guardians of our democracy. They raise the alarm against unethical acts and practices in government and organisations.They speak out in good faith and with a reasonable expectation not only that action will be taken on their disclosures, but that they will be protected and not suffer victimisation or prejudice.In South Africa there is extensive legislative protection for whistleblo-wers, including through the Protected Disclosures Act, Labour Relations Act, Companies Act, Protection against Harassment Act, and the Constitution itself.In addition, the Depart-ment of Justice and Correctional Services, working with other law-enforcement agencies, administers the Office of Witness Protection to pro-vide support to vulnerable and intimidated witnesses in any judicial proceedings.Entering witness pro-tection is voluntary, and neither the SAPS nor the NPA can compel a witness to do so. Should a witness receive threats to their life or feel unsafe, they have to inform investigators and apply for admission to the pro-gramme. This successful programme has played a key role in securing succes-sful prosecutions since its inception, particularly with regards to organised crime.It is clear that as the fight against corruption gathers momentum, we need to urgently review our cur-rent approach not only to witness protection, but also to the broader protection of whistleblowers.While numerous systems are in place to enable whistleblowers to report anonymously, we need to tighten up existing systems and provide greater support to those who publicly come forward with information.As society, we need to identify where existing laws and policies are inadequate in protecting the livelihoods, reputations and safety of whistleblo-wers – and work together to address these.The intent of the criminals who target whistleblowers is not only to silence parti-cular individuals – it is also to send a message to other potential whistleblowers. Day by day, brave South Africans like Babita Deo-karan are standing firm that they will not be party to corruption and they are prepared to bear witness against it.As the South African people, we salute her and all the whistleblowers in the public and private sectors who are exposing corruption to the harshest of glares. They are doing so without expectation of acknowledgement or reward. Theirs is the highest form of public service.We cannot let them down. We must, and we will, ensure that their disclosures result in prosecutions and do much more to ensure that they are protected from harm.As South Africans, we want to send a strong a message that we will not be intimidated. Those behind the killing of witnesses and whistleblowers will be arrested and face the might of the law, as will all who are found guilty of the very corruption these assassins are trying to cover up.
