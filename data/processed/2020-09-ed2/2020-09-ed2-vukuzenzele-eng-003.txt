If you have suffered gender-based violence (GBV) and are in need of support at court, the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has a specialised service to assist you.
The Ke Bona Lesedi Court Preparation Programme is available at most Sexual Offences Courts and other courts that deal with GBV. Ke Bona Lesedi means ‘I see the light’ when translated from Setswana. A GBV victim can submit a request to the NPA for assis-tance. The senior public pros-ecutor or court preparation manager will then identify an appropriate court preparation officer to assist. “The service does not prom-ise a particular outcome in the case and each individ-ual’s experience is unique. Nonetheless, it assists with empowerment and restoring the victim’s dignity,” says a statement from the NPA. There are 161 court prepara-tion officers at various courts across the country. The service is one of vari-ous initiatives introduced by government to deal with the scourge of GBV. According to the NPA, the complainant, victim, survivor or witness will be contacted by a court preparation officer from the court where she or he will testify. The court preparation officer will be available to support the complainant at court and throughout the trial. Special-ised tools and techniques are used to visually show the victim that she or he is heard, protected and respected. Complainants can speak in their own language and the court preparation officer will ensure that the victim is referred for counselling or therapy, to complete their healing journey. Many women and children who have suffered GBV, for example, rape, are anxious about going to court to testify and relate intimate details of events in front of strangers. This service will help them feel more at ease.
