The USAID Tubercu-losis South Africa Project is proving to be a perfect example of how government, com-munities and NGOs can partner together to combat tuberculosis (TB) by pro-viding proper support to patients.
 South Africa has taken a position of leadership in the global fight against TB, and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has stepped in to provide assistance. The five-year project, which started in 2016, is being car-ried out in partnership with the National Department of Health in eight of South Africa’s provinces. One of the most important parts of the project is to support community-based NGOs. The project provides funding to 21 NGOs who have supported more than 3 500 patients, the majority based in rural areas. Free State progressBased in Mangaung, Mosa-moria is one of the NGOs which has received funding from the project. The organi-sation has a team of commu-nity health workers, a project manager and a data capturer who all work towards en-suring that patients stay on treatment so that they can be cured in a six month period. “We employ 74 care givers for this project. Initially we worked with 200 patients, then 400 patients, and in our current contract we have 500 patients who we work with on a daily basis. The patients are referred to us when they have been diagnosed as having TB from nine differ-ent clinics in the Mangaung Metro,” says Mosamaria coordinator Trudie Harrison. Mosamaria conducts monthly door-to-door screening campaigns to find new TB patients and get them on treatment immediately.Harrison says that Mosa-moria’s work has reduced the stigma around TB, built close relationships with the community and also led to much better rates of success-ful treatment.“For example, in 2018, 514 of our patients were cured,” Harrison says. Harrison shares the story of one of Mosamaria’s patients. He was given daily support by a Mosamaria caregiver, who ensured that he swal-lowed his tablets every day and also assisted with maize meal and new clothes. “He completed the treat-ment and was cured. He went back to work as his employer had kept his job for him,” says Harrison.Know the symptoms of TB If you have some of the fol-lowing symptoms, then you should visit your nearest clinic or hospital to be tested for TB:
