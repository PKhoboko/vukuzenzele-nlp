","the youth are our greatest asset vukuzenzele unnamed on june 16th 1976, the youth of soweto and other parts of the country rose up against the iniquity of bantu education.
"
"hi siku rolero na le ka masiku lama nga landzela, vanhu vo tala va lahleke riwe hi vutomi bya vona.
","on that day and in the days that followed, many lost their lives.
"
"va dlayiwile hi mfumo lowo pfumala ntwelavusiwana lowu a wu nga ri na mhaka na vutomi bya vantima na ku nga karhatiwi hi nchumu loko va duvula vana va xikolo lava a va nga hlomangi, lava a va ambale yunifomo.
","they were killed by a callous regime that had little regard for black lives and thought nothing of opening fire on unarmed, uniformed schoolchildren.
"
"swiendleko leswi swi nonohise mavonelo ya matiko ya misava ehenhla ka mfumo wa xihlawuhlawu na ku khutaza ku ya ema hlweni ka nyimpi yo lwela ntshunxeko.
","these events hardened international opinion against the apartheid regime and gave further impetus to the liberation struggle.
"
"vantshwa va tshamile va ri emahlweni ka ku kombisa ku vilela ka vanhu hi mika rhi hinkwayo, kusukela eka ku kombisa ku vilela ko alelana na mafumelo yo lerisa elatin amerika ekuheleni ka malembe ya va1950, kuya eka ku kombisa ku vilela eafrika hinkwayo ekuheleni ka malembe ya va1960.
","young people have always been at the forefront of social protest, from the antiauthoritarian protests in latin america in the late 1950s, to the protests across africa in the late 1960s.
"
"matimu ma rhekhoda hi ndlela yo tshembeka ku hoxa xandla ka rixaka ra 1976 eka nhlangano wa swichudeni wa matiko ya misava na xiyimo xa ka wona ehenhla ka ntshikelelo na nkavululami.
","history faithfully records the contribution of the generation of 1976 to the international student movement and its stance against oppression and injustice.
"
"xiendleko lexa nkoka eka matimu 45 wa malembe lama nga hundza xi ya emahlweni na ku tsundzu kiwa eafrika hinkwayo na le misaveni hinkwayo.
","this historic event 45 years ago continues to be commemorated across africa and the world.
"
"hikokwalaho swi twisaka ku vava leswaku vutivi bya siku ra 16 khotavuxika byi le ku nyamalaleni exikarhi ka vantshwa va laha afrikadzonga.
","it is therefore disturbing that knowledge of june 16th is diminishing among young south africans.
"
"leswi swi tano ngopfungopfu exikarhi ka lava vuriwaka rixaka ra z, kumbe vantshwa lava nga velekiwa exikarhi ka 1997 na 2015. mbalango wa maehleketelelo ya vanhu va afri kadzonga wa 2019/2020 lowu hangalasiweke hi khansele ya ndzavisiso wa tisayense ta ximunhu wu kume leswaku kwalomu ka 40% ta rixaka ra z a ri si tshama ri twa hi swiendleko leswa nkoka eka matimu swa siku ra 16 khotavuxika.
","this is particularly so among the socalled generation z, or young people born between 1997 and 2015. the 2019/2020 south african social attitudes survey published by the human sciences research council found that close to 40% of generation z has not heard of the historical events of june 16th.
"
"nhlayo hi tiphesente leyi fanaka yi twile hi mayelana na swona kambe yi tiva switsongo kumbe ku nga tivi nchumu hi mayelana na swona.
","a similar percentage has heard about it but knows very little or nothing about it.

","nevertheless, the survey also found that young people of this generation are open to learning about key historical events and believe in their continued importance.
"
"hi dinga ku endla swo tala tanihi tiko ku tiyisisa leswaku hungu ra 1976 ri hundziseriwa emahlweni hi ku tshembeka.
","we need to do more as a country to ensure that the message of 1976 is transmitted faithfully.
"
"lebyi i vutihlamuleri bya nhlanganelo bya mfumo, swikolo, mihlangano ya dyondzo ya le henhla, vatswari, mindyangu, vayi mbeleri, vatshila, na rixaka hinkwaro.
","this is a collective responsibility of government, schools, tertiary institutions, parents, families, musicians, artists, and all of society.
"

","the generation that was born after apartheid ended inherited a country with a democratic constitution and where fundamental freedoms are protected.
"
"swivandlanene leswi va ntshwa va vantima va nga na swona namuntlha havumbirhi swi hambanile swinene na ku va swi antswile swinene.
","the opportunities young black people have today are both vastly different and greatly improved.

"ku kondletela xitori xa 16 khotavuxika xi hanya i xitsundzuxo eka rixaka ra namuntlha xa ku titsona swo tala lokukulu loku endli weke ku kuma ntshunxeko.
","keeping the story of june 16th alive is a reminder to today’s generation of the great sacrifices made to secure their freedom.
"
"siku ra vantshwa i xitsu ndzuxo xa matimba lama kulu na vuyimeri bya leswaku vantshwa va fanele ku titumbuluxela vumu ndzuku byo antswa.
","youth day is a reminder of the immense power and agency that young people have to create a better future for themselves.
"
"ku kayakaya ka vantshwa eafrikadzonga namuntlha ku tele.
","the struggles of young people in south africa today are many.
"
"vantshwa va tshame va ri emahlweni ka vugi ngirikeli, hambi eku laveni ka dyondzo ya mahala kumbe ku lwisana na swilo leswi karhataka vanhu ku fana na madzolonga lama simekiweke eka rimbewu.
","young people have remained at the forefront of activism, whether in pursuit of free education or against social ills like genderbased violence.
"
"namuntlha nyimpi le yikulu leyikulukumba leyi vantshwa va nga hi hloma i ku lwisana na ku pfumaleka ka mitirho, leswi nga nyanya ehansi ka ntungukulu wa covid19.
","today the greatest struggle young people wage is against unemployment, which has worsened under the covid19 pandemic.
"
"ku tumbuluxela vantshwa swivandlanene, na ku fikelela swivandlanene swoleswo, i xirhangana lexikulu xa mfumo.
","creating more opportunities for young people, and access to these opportunities, is government’s foremost priority.

","tackling youth unemployment requires accelerating economic growth, particularly in labourintensive sectors, and building the capability of the state to fulfil its developmental role.
"
"hi tlhela hi lawula ajenda leyi hi ku tirhisa miphalalo leyi pakanisiweke.
","we are also driving this agenda through targeted interventions.
"
"leswi swi katsaxihlohloteri xa miti rho wa phuresidente, lexi xi nyikeke swiva ndlanene swa mitirho na nseketelo wa vutihanyisi eka vantshwa.

","we have launched a range of additional measures to create opportunities, enhance skills development, support young entrepreneurs and enable the full participation of young people in the economy.
"
"leswi swi katsa ku tumbu luxiwa ka netiweke ya malawulelo ya ndlela ya rixaka, vantshwa va afrikadzonga, ku olovi sela vantshwa ku vona na ku fikelela swivandlanene na ku kuma nseketelo lowu tirhaka wo kuma tindlela to nghena eka makete wa vatirhi.
","this includes the establishment of a national pathway management network, sa youth, to make it easier for young people to view and access opportunities and receive active support to find pathways into the labour market.
"
"leswi swi kumeka exi karhi ka swirhangana swa mphalalo wa ku thoriwa ka vantshwa wa phuresidente, loku nga simekiwa mavhiki hi nga se nghena eka ku pfariwa ka tiko hinkwaro lembe leri nga hundza naswona leswi se swi sungulaka ku tirhisiwa hi ku hetiseka.
","these are among the priorities of the presidential youth employment intervention, which was launched just weeks before we entered a national lockdown last year and which is now entering full implementation.

","the presidential youth employment intervention was built on the understanding that addressing the youth unemployment crisis requires innovative thinking and strong partnerships across society.
"
"xikongomelo xa wona xo hetelela i ku kuma timo dlolo leti ti tirhaka, hambi eka nhluvukiso wa swikili kumbe tipholisi ta makete wa vatirhi leti tirhaka, na ku swi pima hi xihatla ku fikelela vantshwa vo tala hilaha swi kotekaka hakona.
","its ultimate objective is to find models that work, whether in skills development or active labour market policies, and to scale these rapidly to reach as many young people as possible.
"
"xa nkoka swinene, wu tekela enhlokweni leswaku vantshwa va boheka ku va exivindzini xa matshalatshala wahi kumbe wahi ya ku nyika matimba ku thoriwa ka vantshwa.
