"
"oku kuquka ubunzima bokufikelela kwimali yokuqalisa kunye nokwandisa ishishini kunye nokubanakho kweesmme ukufumana iimarike zeemveliso zazo.

"
"amashishini angawabantu abamnyama basetyhini, ingakumbi, adibana nobunzima ekuthatheni iintengiselwano zokuxhobisa ngokomlinganiselo omkhulu.
","black womenowned businesses, in particular, encounter difficulties in taking on largescale empowerment transactions.

","we have a shared responsibility to drive the effort to entrench bbbee because it is about eradicating inequality.
"
"uqoqosho olungalinganiyo luvelisa uluntu olungalinganiyo, kwaye uluntu olungalinganiyo aluhlumi kwaye aluphumeleli.
","unequal economies breed unequal societies, and unequal societies don’t grow and flourish.
"
"ayiyonto engalunganga nje kuphela, kodwa kukwayinto engagcinakaliyo, ukuba amashishini agcine ulawulo lwawo nobunini bezakhiwo ikakhulu kubantu abamhlophe okanye amadoda.
","it is not only wrong, but also unsustainable, for businesses to keep their management and ownership structures mostly white or male.
"
"ngapha koko, luluntu lwasemzantsi afrika olungabathengi abaphambili beempahla kunye neenkonzo zalo.
","it is, after all, the south african public that are the primary consumers of their goods and services.
"
"oku kufuneka kuboniswe kwii ndlela ezahlukeneyo zokuqesha kunye nokulawula, kubunini nakwinkqubo yokufumana abanikizinkonzo.
","this should be reflected in diversity of hiring and management practices, in ownership and in procurement.
