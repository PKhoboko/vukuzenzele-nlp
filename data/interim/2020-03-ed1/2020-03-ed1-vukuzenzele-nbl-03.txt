UNtaka 2020 umGadangiso 1 OKUMUMETHWEKOHlela Iimali Zakho Ngokuhlakanipha*UDorh. Rufaro Mucheka (PhD) umHleli wezeeMali oFakazelweko obuye godu abe siKhulu sokuHlelela amaHlelo we-Afrika yoke ephikweni lokuHlelela IiMali kwa-Nedbank. *Dorh Rufaro MuchekaUmnyaka omutjha ulithuba lokuthoma ngobutjha, lokuzibekela iminqopho ekhulumako, lokwakha imikghwa emitjha bewulungise neendlela zakho zokusebenzisa imali ebewu zisebenzisa ngeenkhathi ezidluli leko, ukuqinisekisa ukuthi ingo muso lakho lisimelela ngcono.
 Ubujamo bezomnotho bomnyaka wee-2020 bubonakala inga bungahle bube budisi khudlwana ukudlula bomnyaka wee-2019, ngalok-ho-ke kuqakathekile ukuthi uziqale uziqalisise iindlela osebenzisa ngazo imalakho.
 Ukufika ekululekweni yemali mnqopho okhanukelwa mu-muntu woke, kodwana bayirharakatjhana abantu abaziko ukuthi kufuze bathome kuphi. Ukuba nemikghwa emihle yezeemali embadlwana kuzakusiza ukwenza umnyakakho omutjha ube yipumelelo.
Ukuqinisekisa ukuthi uyaphu-melela ukuzalisa iminqopho yakho yeemali, ungalandela iminqopho ye-SMART uzakhele ingomuso leemali elinzinzileko. Lokhu-ke kutjho uku-zibekela iminqopho:
• Enqophileko (Specific)• Elinganisekako (Measurable)• Efikelelekako (Achievable)• Efaneleko (Relevant)• Engesikhathi (Time-bound).  Ukudlula lapho, kuqakathe kile ukuthi uhlele iimali zakho ngokutjheja nokuyelela. Nanzi ezinye iiyeleliso ezingakusiza:Beka iminqopho yakho yeemali Sebenzela phezu kwendlela osebenze ngayo ngokuzithiba nokuzikhalima eemalini zakhoemnyakeni wee-2019 bese uzibekela iminqopho emitjha yomnyaka wee-2020.

Vala iinkwelede zakho  Bekela ngeqadi imali egade isimetjhe namkha yebhonasi neyokukhu tjhulwa komrholo uyisebenzisele ukuvala iinkwelede, ngoba phela ukuvala iinkwelede msinyana kungakulondela imali ebonakalako yemalinzalo.
 Yenza amatjhuguluko esabelweni sakho seemali ngokweendingo  zakho Lokhuya nawulandelela ii ndlela nemikghwa osebenzisa ngayo imali, yenza amatjhuguluko afaneleko esabelweni sakho seemali, ngezelela inani lemali oyibekako wehlise oyisebenzi sako. Lokhuya nawukhutjhule lwa umrholo, thatha enye yemali okhutjhulelwe ngayo umrholo uyilonde kunobanyana ukhuphule inani lemali oyisebenzisela ukukhuphula izinga nendlela yokuphila kamnandi khulu. Buyekeza amatjhorensakho  – Hlola itjhorense yepilo, yomzimba kho, yokukhubazeka kunye ne tjhorense yesikhathi esifitjhani ukuqinisekisa ukuthi inani lemali elapho liyakhambisana neendi ngo zakho.
Khuluma nomkakho ngokutjha phuluka nawukhuluma ngeemali
 Kunomukghwa wokuthi abantu abezwanako bafihlelane iindaba zeemali. Bambani imikhulumi swana qobe yinyanga nikhu lumisane ngesabelo seemali, iminqopho yakho yeemali nezi nto enizifunako ngobubili benu ngomuso. Yenzani isikhathi so kwakha inembombono ekha mbisanako emalungana noku thi nifuna ingomuso elinjani ndawonye.Phungula imali oyibekela ukuzithabisa  – Thola izinto ezenziwa simahla, njengamaphaga, amalayibhrari nokhunye ongakwenza ngapha ndle kokukhupha imali endaweni yangekhenu.
Iiyeleliso ezizakusiza bona uhlale ukhamba ngehlelo lakho: Akusiyinto ehlala ilula ngaso soke isikhathi ukukhamba nge ndlela yehlelo lakho leemali nje ngoba ulihlelile, ungaphambuki, kodwana hlala unqophe:  • Ukuhlala uhlola ama akhawundi wakho webha nga – uhlole ukuthi uyise benzisa kangangani imali.• Ukuzilungiselela ukudana.• Ukubalekela ukungena eenkweledeni ongakazihleleli
  • Ukuthenga ngokuhlakanipha. Zibuze: Ngikufuna mbala lokhu na? Ingabe kuyingcenye yehlelo lami leemali lokhu na?• Ukubonana nomeluleki ngezeemali nakube awazi ukuthi kufuze uthome phi. 

If you want your school to be part of the programme, you can email info@empowervate.org for enquiries. Learners transforming communities More Matshediso Empowervate Trust is a youth development non-profit organisation (NPO) that works in partner-ship with the Department of Basic Education (DBE) to give learners an opportunity to be-come agents of change in their communities. It runs a well-established ini-tiative called the Youth Citizens Action Programme (Y-CAP), which is a competition-based programme that encourages learners from primary and secondary schools to identi-fy challenges affecting their schools and communities and come up with solutions. Empowervate Trust Founder and Chief Executive Officer Amanda Blankfield-Koseff said the idea to establish the programme came to her while she was working for a non-gov-ernmental organisation as a marketing manager. Back then, she was respon-sible for facilitating youth dialogues to discuss problems facing communities. “I realised that young people were excited to be given a platform to talk about issues affecting their communities and to suggest solutions, but it was just a ‘talk show’ and that eventually discouraged them,” she explained. Blankfield-Koseff suggested to her boss that the programme be changed into an action pro-gramme so that it could be im-pactful, with concrete results, and was given the go-ahead to run with the project. It was decided that it would proceed as a school competition to in-centivise participation.The programme was pitched to the education department and in 2010, Y-CAP held its first competition. The pilot project was run in four provinces – the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, the Western Cape and Gauteng. Last year, 400 schools from across the country participated. Four teams from different schools including primary, sec-ondary, beginner and advanced level categories won a tablet and R5000 each for coming first place, and four teams that came second place won R2500 each. Oranje Oewer Primary School in the Northern Cape won the 2019 beginner category. The team won first prize for a waste management project to keep their school environment clean. Because Y-CAP is a partner-ship between an NPO and a government department, it won the Special Ministerial Award in the 17th Public Sector Innovation Awards 2019. The DBE said partnerships with civil society are important because they are instrumental in mobilising society in support of the education of learners. It explained that while the school takes care of formal curricular education matters for children, civil society strengthens the informal co-curricular educa-tional aspects, which are es-sential for the development of a well-rounded and holistically educated child.
