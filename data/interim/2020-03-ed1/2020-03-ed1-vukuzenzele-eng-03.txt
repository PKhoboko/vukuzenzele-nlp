The economic conditions  for 2020 look likely to be even tougher than in 2019, so it is imperative that you take a hard and objective look at your personal finances. Achieving financial independence is an admirable goal, but very few people know where to start.

• Specific • Measurable • Achievable • Relevant • Time-bound. In addition, it is important that you plan your finances carefully. Here are some tips to help you along:Set your financial goals Reflect on your financial discipline in 2019 and set new goals for 2020.
Settle your debts Put any spare funds or bonuses and salary increases towards eliminating debt, as paying off debt quicker could save you a significant amount of interest.Adjust your budget as needed  As you track your spending habits, make necessary adjustments to your budget, increase your savings and decrease your spend ing. If you receive a salary increase, allocate some to your savings rather than increasing your lifestyle spending.Review your insurance policies  – Eval uate your life, health, disability and short-term insurance to ensure that the amounts match your needs.
Freely talk with your spouse about money There is a tendency for spouses to hide financial issues from each other. Have monthly meetings to discuss budgets, your financial goals and what you both want for the future. Take time to build a shared vision of what you want your future together to look like. Reduce your entertainment budget  Find free activities, such as parks, libraries and things to do in your neighbourhood. There are plenty of ways to have fun without spending money.

Learners transforming communities More Matshediso Empowervate Trust is a youth development non-profit organisation (NPO) that works in partner-ship with the Department of Basic Education (DBE) to give learners an opportunity to be-come agents of change in their communities. It runs a well-established ini-tiative called the Youth Citizens Action Programme (Y-CAP), which is a competition-based programme that encourages learners from primary and secondary schools to identi-fy challenges affecting their schools and communities and come up with solutions. Empowervate Trust Founder and Chief Executive Officer Amanda Blankfield-Koseff said the idea to establish the programme came to her while she was working for a non-gov-ernmental organisation as a marketing manager. Back then, she was respon-sible for facilitating youth dialogues to discuss problems facing communities. “I realised that young people were excited to be given a platform to talk about issues affecting their communities and to suggest solutions, but it was just a ‘talk show’ and that eventually discouraged them,” she explained. Blankfield-Koseff suggested to her boss that the programme be changed into an action pro-gramme so that it could be im-pactful, with concrete results, and was given the go-ahead to run with the project. It was decided that it would proceed as a school competition to in-centivise participation.The programme was pitched to the education department and in 2010, Y-CAP held its first competition. The pilot project was run in four provinces – the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, the Western Cape and Gauteng. Last year, 400 schools from across the country participated. Four teams from different schools including primary, sec-ondary, beginner and advanced level categories won a tablet and R5000 each for coming first place, and four teams that came second place won R2500 each. Oranje Oewer Primary School in the Northern Cape won the 2019 beginner category. The team won first prize for a waste management project to keep their school environment clean. Because Y-CAP is a partner-ship between an NPO and a government department, it won the Special Ministerial Award in the 17th Public Sector Innovation Awards 2019. The DBE said partnerships with civil society are important because they are instrumental in mobilising society in support of the education of learners. It explained that while the school takes care of formal curricular education matters for children, civil society strengthens the informal co-curricular educa-tional aspects, which are es-sential for the development of a well-rounded and holistically educated child.
