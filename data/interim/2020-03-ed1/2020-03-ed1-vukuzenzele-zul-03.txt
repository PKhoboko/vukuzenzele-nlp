Ndasa 2020 Ushicilelo 1 OKUQUKETHWEHlela Izimali Zakho Ngobuhlakani *Dkt Rufaro MuchekaUkuqala konyaka  omusha kuyithuba elihle lokuqala kabusha, ukuzibekela izifiso eziphusile, ukuqala imi khuba emisha nokushintsha indlela obusebenzisa ngayo imali ukuze uqinisekise ukuthi uba nekusasa eline ntuthuko.
Izimo zomnotho zonyaka wezi-2020 zibukeka zizoba nzima ukwedlula ezowezi -2019, ngakho-ke kubalulekile ukuthi ubheke ngeso lokhozi futhi ucubungule isimo sakho sezimali. Ukuthola inkululeko  kwezezimali kuyiphupho noma ubani angalifisa, kodwa-ke bayingcosana abantu abanolwazi ukuthi bangaqala kuphi. Ukwenza imikhutshana emihle yezezimali kuzokusiza ukuhlelela unyaka wakho omusha ube impumelelo.Ukuqinisekisa ukuthi uyazifeza izifiso zakho zezimali, ungasebenzisa indlela yokufeza izifiso nebizwa nge-SMART ukuze uqinisekise izinga olifisayo kwezezimali. Lokhu kuchaza ukuthi uhlela  izifiso zakho ngendlela yokuthi:
• Ziqonde ngqo (Specific)• Ziyalinganiseka (Measurable)• Ziyafezeka (Achievable)• Zifanelekile (Relevant)• Zingafezeka ngesikhathi (Time -bound)Ukwengeza kulokhu, kuba-lulekile ukuthi uhlele izimali zakho ngokucophelela.  Nawa amanye amacebo angakusiza kakhulu ekuhleleni:Hlela izifiso zakho zezimali,  Buyekeza indlela obuphatha ngayo imali onyakeni wezi-2019 bese uhlela izifiso ezintsha  zonyaka wezi-2020.
Khokha zonke izikweletu zakho  Qongelela imali esalayo noma amabhonasi nale ekukhushulwe ngayo umholo ukuze uyisebenzise ekunciphiseni izikweletu, lokhu kukhokha izikweletu zakho ngokushesha kungasiza ukuthi wonge ekukhokheni inzalo.
Shintsha ibhajethi yakho ngo kufanele  Uma ubheka indlela osebenzisa ngayo imali, yenza izinguquko ezinesidingo ebhajethini yakho, khuphula imali oyongayo bese wehlisa imali oyisebenzisayo. Uma ukhushulelwe umholo, thatha enye ima-li uyonge ukunokuthi wandise izindleko zempilo.
Buyekeza imishwalense yakho – Hlolisisa impilo yakho, ezempilo, ukukhubazeka kanye nemishwalense yesikhashana ukuqinisekisa ukuthi  imali iya-hambisana nezidingo zakho. Khuluma ukhululeke nalowo ozwana naye mayelana nemali Kunomkhuba omubi ovamile kubantu  abashadile wokufi-hlelana izindaba zezimali. Ku-mele nihlangane nyangazonke nikhulume ngebhajethi, izifiso zenu zezimali kanye nalokho enikufisayo nobabili ngekusasa lenu. Zinikeni isikhathi ukuba nabelane ngombono wekusasa wokuthi ikusasa nindawonye nifuna libe njani.  Yehlisa ibhajethi ehlelelwe ukuzijabu lisaThola indlela yokuzijabu-lisa ngaphandle kokukhokha imali, njengamapaki, imitapo yolwazi kanye nezinto onga-zenza endaweni yangakini. Ziningi kakhulu izindlela zokuzijabulisa ngaphandle kokukhokha imali.
Nawa amathiphu azokusiza ukuhlala ohlelweni lwakhoUkubambelela ngqi kumklamo wakho wezezimali akusiyo into elula, kodwa yiba nenhloso yokuthi:
• Qikelela ukuthi uyayihlola imali yakho njalo esebhange – zihlole ukuthi uyisebenzisa kanjani imali.• Zilungiselele izikhathi ezizokubuyisela emuva.• Hlukana nezikweletu ezingahlelelwe.• Thenga ngobuhlakani. Zibuze ukuthi: Ngakube lokhu ngiyakudinga na? Ngakube lokhu kuyi ngxenye yohlelo lwami lwezimali na? • Hlangana nomeluleki wezezimali uma ungazi ukuthi uqale kuphi.
 vSET YOUR FINANCIAL GOALS*U-Dkt. u-Rufaro Mucheka (PhD) onguMhleli wezeziMali Osemthethweni noYinhloko ye-Strategy and Rest Of Africa esikhungweni sezimali sakwa-Nedbank.If you want your school to be part of the programme, you can email info@empowervate.org for enquiries. Learners transforming communities More Matshediso Empowervate Trust is a youth development non-profit organisation (NPO) that works in partner-ship with the Department of Basic Education (DBE) to give learners an opportunity to be-come agents of change in their communities. It runs a well-established ini-tiative called the Youth Citizens Action Programme (Y-CAP), which is a competition-based programme that encourages learners from primary and secondary schools to identi-fy challenges affecting their schools and communities and come up with solutions. Empowervate Trust Founder and Chief Executive Officer Amanda Blankfield-Koseff said the idea to establish the programme came to her while she was working for a non-gov-ernmental organisation as a marketing manager. Back then, she was respon-sible for facilitating youth dialogues to discuss problems facing communities. “I realised that young people were excited to be given a platform to talk about issues affecting their communities and to suggest solutions, but it was just a ‘talk show’ and that eventually discouraged them,” she explained. Blankfield-Koseff suggested to her boss that the programme be changed into an action pro-gramme so that it could be im-pactful, with concrete results, and was given the go-ahead to run with the project. It was decided that it would proceed as a school competition to in-centivise participation.The programme was pitched to the education department and in 2010, Y-CAP held its first competition. The pilot project was run in four provinces – the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, the Western Cape and Gauteng. Last year, 400 schools from across the country participated. Four teams from different schools including primary, sec-ondary, beginner and advanced level categories won a tablet and R5000 each for coming first place, and four teams that came second place won R2500 each. Oranje Oewer Primary School in the Northern Cape won the 2019 beginner category. The team won first prize for a waste management project to keep their school environment clean. Because Y-CAP is a partner-ship between an NPO and a government department, it won the Special Ministerial Award in the 17th Public Sector Innovation Awards 2019. The DBE said partnerships with civil society are important because they are instrumental in mobilising society in support of the education of learners. It explained that while the school takes care of formal curricular education matters for children, civil society strengthens the informal co-curricular educa-tional aspects, which are es-sential for the development of a well-rounded and holistically educated child.
