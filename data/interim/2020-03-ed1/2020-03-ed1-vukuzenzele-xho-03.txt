Zibuze: Ingaba nyani ndiyayidinga le nto? Ingaba le nto yinxalenye yesicwa ngciso sam sezezimali? • Dibana nomcebisi wezezimali ukuba awuyazi ukuba  ungaqala phi.  vUGq Rufaro Mucheka (PhD) nguMcwangcisi wezeziMali oMiselweyo nokwayiNtloko yeStrategy and Rest Of Africa kwiCandelo loCwangcizo-zimali eNedbank. EMINYE IMIBA GABALALAIf you want your school to be part of the programme, you can email info@empowervate.org for enquiries. Learners transforming communities More Matshediso Empowervate Trust is a youth development non-profit organisation (NPO) that works in partner-ship with the Department of Basic Education (DBE) to give learners an opportunity to be-come agents of change in their communities. It runs a well-established ini-tiative called the Youth Citizens Action Programme (Y-CAP), which is a competition-based programme that encourages learners from primary and secondary schools to identi-fy challenges affecting their schools and communities and come up with solutions. Empowervate Trust Founder and Chief Executive Officer Amanda Blankfield-Koseff said the idea to establish the programme came to her while she was working for a non-gov-ernmental organisation as a marketing manager. Back then, she was respon-sible for facilitating youth dialogues to discuss problems facing communities. “I realised that young people were excited to be given a platform to talk about issues affecting their communities and to suggest solutions, but it was just a ‘talk show’ and that eventually discouraged them,” she explained. Blankfield-Koseff suggested to her boss that the programme be changed into an action pro-gramme so that it could be im-pactful, with concrete results, and was given the go-ahead to run with the project. It was decided that it would proceed as a school competition to in-centivise participation.The programme was pitched to the education department and in 2010, Y-CAP held its first competition. The pilot project was run in four provinces – the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, the Western Cape and Gauteng. Last year, 400 schools from across the country participated. Four teams from different schools including primary, sec-ondary, beginner and advanced level categories won a tablet and R5000 each for coming first place, and four teams that came second place won R2500 each. Oranje Oewer Primary School in the Northern Cape won the 2019 beginner category. The team won first prize for a waste management project to keep their school environment clean. Because Y-CAP is a partner-ship between an NPO and a government department, it won the Special Ministerial Award in the 17th Public Sector Innovation Awards 2019. The DBE said partnerships with civil society are important because they are instrumental in mobilising society in support of the education of learners. It explained that while the school takes care of formal curricular education matters for children, civil society strengthens the informal co-curricular educa-tional aspects, which are es-sential for the development of a well-rounded and holistically educated child.
