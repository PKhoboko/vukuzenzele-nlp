Indlovulenkhulu 2020 Lushicilelo 1 Hlela Timali Takho Ngekuhlakanipha*Dkt. Rufaro MuchekaLomnyaka lomusha ulitfuba lekucala kabusha, kubeka imigomo lemisha lebhadlile, yekwakha imikhuba lemihle lemisha uphindze futsi ulungise tindlela bewusebentisa ngato imali esikhatsini lesendlulile kute ucinisekise likusasa lelisimeme kakhulu.
Timo temnotfo tanga-2020 tibukeka sengatsi titawuba matima kakhulu kuna nga-2019, ngako-ke kuyacindzetela kutsi ubuke timali takho nge-liso lelusoti nekutsi ungavuni  luhlangotsi. Kuzuza kutimela ngekwetimali kungumgomo loncomekako, kepha bambalwa bantfu laba-tiko kutsi kufanele kutsi ucale kuphi. Kuba nemikhuba lemi-hle lembalwa mayelana nemali kutakusita kutsi uhlele kahle umnyaka wakho lomusha ube yimphumelelo.Kute wente siciniseko sekutsi uyayizuza imigomo yakho yetetimali, ungasebentisa imi-gomo le-SMART yelikusasa le-livikelekile ngekwetimali. Loku kusho kubeka imigomo le:
• Specific [Condze ngco] • Measurable [Kalekako] • Achievable [Zuzekako] • Relevant [Fanele] • Time-bound [Miselwe sikhatsi]. Kwengeta, kubalulekile kutsi uhlela timali takho ngekucaphela. Nankha emathiphu  langakusita uma wenta njalo:Beka imigomo yakho yetetima-li Buyeketa indlela botiphetse ngayo ngekwetimali nga-2019 bese utibekela imigomo  lemisha ya-2020.
Khokhela tonkhe tikweleti takho Faka nanoma ngutiphi timali letisipele noma emabhonasi nalokhushulelwe ngayo umholo etikweletini kute uticedze, ngoba kukhokhela sikweleti masinyane kukongela imali lenkhulu yentalo lobota yikhokha.Lungisa sabelomali sakho ngekuya kwesidzingo Lapho ulandzelela imikhuba yakho yekusebentisa imali, yenta tilungiso letifanele kusabelomali sakho, khulisa imali yakho loyongako bese wehlisa lizinga losebentisa ngalo imali yakho. Uma ngabe ukhushulelwa umholo, faka lenye kuleyo lo yongako kune kutsi ukhuphule lusebentisomali lwakho lwe ndlelakuphila.Buyeketa emapholisi emshwalensi wakho – Hlola imphilo yakho, temphilo, umshwalensi wekukhubateka newesikhashana kute wente siciniseko sekutsi lamanani eti-mali ayahambisana netidzingo takho. Khuluma nendvoza/umfati wakho ngekukhululeka mayelana netimali – Kune mkhuba lomubi lowentiwa ngulabashadene wekufihlelana tindzaba tetimali. Bambani imihlangano yanjalo ngenya nga nicocisane ngesabelomali, imigomo yenu yemali naloko lenikufunako nobabili kweli kusasa.  Tinikeni sikhatsi na khe umbononchanti ninobabili wekutsi nifuna likusasa lenu libukeke njani.  Nciphisa sabelomali sakho sekutijabulisa Tfola tindzawo longaya kuto mahhala netintfo tamahhala longatenta, njengemapaki, imitapolwati kanye netintfo longatenta esigodzini sakho. Kunetindlela letinyenti tekutijabulisa ngaphandle kwekusebentisa imali.Emasu ekukusita kutsi uhlale kulisu lakho ungesuki Kuhlala kulisu lakho letetimali ungesuki akusiyo intfo lelula ngaso sonkhe sikhatsi, kepha hlosa ku• Hlala njalo uhlola i-akhawu nti yakho yasebhange – hlo la indlela losebentisa ngayo  imali yakho.• Hlala ulungele tinkinga leti ngakuvelela.• Ngatifaki etikweletini leti ngakahlelwa.• Tsenga ngekuhlakanipha.
 Tibute loku: Ingabe loku ngi kudzinga mbamba? Ingabe loku kuyincenye yelisu lami letetimali? • Hlangana nalowelulakana ngetetimali uma ngabe awati kutsi ufanele kucala kuphi.

Learners transforming communities More Matshediso Empowervate Trust is a youth development non-profit organisation (NPO) that works in partner-ship with the Department of Basic Education (DBE) to give learners an opportunity to be-come agents of change in their communities. It runs a well-established ini-tiative called the Youth Citizens Action Programme (Y-CAP), which is a competition-based programme that encourages learners from primary and secondary schools to identi-fy challenges affecting their schools and communities and come up with solutions. Empowervate Trust Founder and Chief Executive Officer Amanda Blankfield-Koseff said the idea to establish the programme came to her while she was working for a non-gov-ernmental organisation as a marketing manager. Back then, she was respon-sible for facilitating youth dialogues to discuss problems facing communities. “I realised that young people were excited to be given a platform to talk about issues affecting their communities and to suggest solutions, but it was just a ‘talk show’ and that eventually discouraged them,” she explained. Blankfield-Koseff suggested to her boss that the programme be changed into an action pro-gramme so that it could be im-pactful, with concrete results, and was given the go-ahead to run with the project. It was decided that it would proceed as a school competition to in-centivise participation.The programme was pitched to the education department and in 2010, Y-CAP held its first competition. The pilot project was run in four provinces – the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, the Western Cape and Gauteng. Last year, 400 schools from across the country participated. Four teams from different schools including primary, sec-ondary, beginner and advanced level categories won a tablet and R5000 each for coming first place, and four teams that came second place won R2500 each. Oranje Oewer Primary School in the Northern Cape won the 2019 beginner category. The team won first prize for a waste management project to keep their school environment clean. Because Y-CAP is a partner-ship between an NPO and a government department, it won the Special Ministerial Award in the 17th Public Sector Innovation Awards 2019. The DBE said partnerships with civil society are important because they are instrumental in mobilising society in support of the education of learners. It explained that while the school takes care of formal curricular education matters for children, civil society strengthens the informal co-curricular educa-tional aspects, which are es-sential for the development of a well-rounded and holistically educated child.
