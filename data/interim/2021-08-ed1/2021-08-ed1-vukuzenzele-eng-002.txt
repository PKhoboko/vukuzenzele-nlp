Vuk’uzenzele5August 2021 Edition 1SANDF fights COVID-19PANDEMIC HEROES AND HEROINESPANDEMIC HEROES AND HEROINESMore Matshediso The South African National Defence Force (SANDF) is helping fight the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic in Gauteng, which is currently the epicentre of the third wave.The SANDF is assisting with mass community test ing, screening and contact tracing, and is also lending a hand at hospitals.The South African Military Health Service was deployed in the province to ease the burden on healthcare workers.
A Medical Task Group has been stationed at Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital in Johannesburg.
With Gauteng recording the highest number of COVID-19 cases during the third wave, the hospital was named a pro vincial health facility and is now dedicated to patients with COVID-19.
Before assuming their duties, the Medical Task Group had to be vaccinated so that they could be kept safe while handling the increased number of positive cases and hospital admissions.
Medical Task Group Commander Colonel Fezeka Mabona, who is a professional nurse, says she works on the ground with other members of the group. “The group comprises vari-ous healthcare professionals, including nurses, doctors, clinical associates and occu pational health and safety professionals,” she says.
The majority of the nurses have nursing qualifications at the degree level, with different specialities, including primary healthcare.
“Some nurses are theatre tr ained. All of us have worked as general nurses, midwives, nurse educators and manag-ers in both the military and public health system,” she adds.
The group is divided into task teams and work with the hospital staff in shifts, according to the demand at the facility. The team is currently providing healthcare services in six wards.
“The hospital staff is quite low to handle the number of cases at the moment. It is very important for us to try as much as we can to assist them in order for all of us to avoid further strain on the health care system,” says Mabona.
She adds that the team spirit between nurses from the SANDF and the public healthcare system has been positive so far.
Due to the increase in COVID-19 cases, the hospi tal is also expected to receive more beds, to increase its 96-bed capacity to accommo-date more patients.
 vPandemic sparks good deedsKgaogelo LetsebeSouth Africans have been hard-hit by the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), with many losing loved ones and struggling to earn a living during these difficult times.
But the pandemic ha s also resulted in stories and acts of hope, with people standing together and offering each other help and support.
This is the case for the Ga-Rankuwa community in Gauteng.Following the Level 5 lockdown in March last year, the Ga-Rankuwa Presbyterian Church’s Reverend Thando Mpambani put a Church in Society Committee in place to help people in need. “The journey started with the vision to support the needy. We initially identified 12 families that were in dire need. The needs varied, but a common theme was food,” says committee Chairperson Khutjo Leburu.
The committee rallied the church’s congregation and neigh bours to put substantial food parcels together. “COVID-19 continues to have a profound effect on society, therefore it’s everyone’s responsibility to share the little we have with those in need. Instead of just having a food drive, we decided to run various drives.
“This year alone we have dis tributed school shoes to needy families, thousands of second-hand and new shoes to Shoes4souls, toi letries to 86 Grade 7 learners at Ikageng Primary School and we are busy with a blanket drive,” says Leburu.
While the Level 5 lockdown is a thing of the past, its effect still lingers and many families are still struggling to recover financially.
Leburu says that as long as there are families in need, the church’s work in the community is not done.
“Churches, as institution of God, are mandated to support others and fulfil the Messiah’s mission.
It is time c hurches start playing active roles in the community, open their doors to the needy and stop operating in isolation. We aim to continue to do this,” she adds.Members of the South African Military Health Service who are helping staff at Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital care for COVID-19 patients.
