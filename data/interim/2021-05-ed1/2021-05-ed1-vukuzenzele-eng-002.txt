Vuk’uzenzeleMay 2021 Edition  14 HEALTHThanking our nursesAllison CooperThe country’s nurses, along with other medical staff, have put their lives on the line to help others during the Coronavirus Disease (COV ID-19) pandemic.
International Nurses Day, which is on 12 May, is an op-portunity to celebrate nurses for their service to others.Professional nurse Luyanda Ganuganu (25), from Groote Schuur Hospital in the West-ern Cape, says the day is also an opportunity for nurses to continue to shine the bright light of their profession.“It’s an opportunity for nurses to be recognised, but we must continue to provide quality care, especially dur-ing the pandemic,” he says.Ganuganu was on the frontline during the pandemic’s first and second wave, working at the hospital’s high care COVID-19 ward. “The best part was the experience gained while working with patients, but the worst part was all the deaths that took place in the ward. Emotionally, that was not easy.”Ganuganu, who has been a professional nurse for the past two years, chose the profession because he loves helping people. “I grew up in a rural area in the Eastern Cape and could see how people struggled due to a lack of clinics with nursing care. This developed my passion for wanting to make a difference,” he says.During the pandemic, Ganuganu has had to learn to work under pressure. “Decisions have to be made quickly and you have to think on your feet. I also learnt how to communicate with patients,” he adds.Ganuganu found it very difficult to go to work during the second wave. While he wanted to help others, he also feared for his own family. “I got married in December 2020 and my wife is pregnant. I have seen a lot of pregnant women die in the COVID-19 ward. I had to be even more careful because I did not want to put my wife’s life in danger,” he says.Ganuganu is grateful to his managers and colleagues. “I want to thank them for their support and for giving me the opportunity to grow as a nurse. It’s an awesome experience to work with colleagues who support younger staff.”His message to the community is to help nurses by being responsible.  “Help us to help you. Every-one knows what is expected of them during COVID-19. Please continue to follow all the guidelines and proto-cols,” says Ganuganu.

Jubilee Hospital facelift eases patient pressure A NEW TRAINING  facility, CT scanner and renovated ward at Jubilee Hospital will result in better patient care.
Kgaogelo LetsebeJubilee Hospital in Hammanskraal, Gauteng, has undergone a major facelift and expansion that will see it not only increasing its capacity to handle patients, but also becoming a training facility for medical students.
The Gauteng Department of Health recently unveiled the renovated ward, computerised tomography (CT) scanner and a training lab to be used by medical students.Gauteng Health MEC, Dr Nomathemba Mokgethi, said the improvements will ease the constant burden on the hospital. “Because of the hospital’s close proximity to the N1 and R101 roads, it has been flooded by trauma and emergency cases as a result of car accidents,” she noted.  The renovated ward 4, with 31 allocated beds, will improve the hospital’s capacity to handle these cases. The ward was previously closed and will now be used as an orthopaedic ward.In 2020, the hospital was earmarked to provide Coronavirus Disease services and received an alternative building technology structure with 300 beds.“The addition of 300 beds to the hospital’s existing 551-bed capacity means it is growing not only in terms of size, but in offering more services to the community. “At present, the hospital is admitting all surgical patients, including general surgery, orthopaedics, urology, ophthalmology and gynaecology, to the same ward. We will now be able to separate the various units,” said Jubilee Hospital Acting CEO, Dr Olebogeng Modise.The new CT scanner will also mean fewer transfers to Dr George Mukhari Academic Hospital. A CT scanner enables doctors to examine patients internally through X-ray images taken from different angles. Images of bones, blood vessels and soft tissues can be obtained, thereby providing more detailed information than plain X-rays. “We are now able to admit more trauma patients and with the CT scanner, we can deal with trauma cases quicker than we were able to in the past,” said Dr Modise.
The training facility will be used to train medical students in various fields, including surgery, emergency medicine and obstetrics.
 The renovated ward 4 at Jubilee Hospital will ensure better care for patients.
