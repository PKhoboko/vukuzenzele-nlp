Dale Hes Young firefighter Vuyiseka Arendse (26) is part of Crew Juliet, South Africa’s first all-female wildland firefighting team. Her strength and determination to make a name for herself in the male-dominated world of firefighting is a true inspiration to all women.
Arendse grew up in the small Western Cape town of Beaufort West. After school, she tried studying at a college in Oudtshoorn, but decided to move back home to support her family. She worked at a supermarket for a while, but then firefighting caught her eye. “I saw the firefighters in their uniforms and the big red trucks. I immediately became interested and wanted to find out more,” says Arendse. Arendse was one of the graduates of the Western Cape government’s Chrysalis Academy youth development programme in 2016. After the programme, she worked at the fire station in Beaufort West, earning only R1 900 per month. But then she came across an opportunity offered by NCC Environmental Ser-vices last year. “I was at Chrysalis Acade-my as a facilitator when NCC came to talk to the students about the opportunity to ap-ply for training for the first all-female wildland firefight-ing team. Even though I was not one of the students, I was very interested and applied for the training, and I was accepted,” Arendse says. Arendse went through the training, which combined theory and practical aspects of firefighting. “I learnt so much. For one, I didn’t know that there were firefighters tasked with putting out wildfires. I had previously thought they only worked in towns to put out fires in buildings,” she says. Arendse adds that it was an amazing feeling to pass the training and become part of the first all-female firefight-ing team of its kind. “I felt very excited, espe-cially because when I had told people I wanted to be a firefighter, many of them said I could not do it because I am a woman and would not cope with the job. This pushed me to show them that I can actu-ally do it, not only for myself but for the rest of the women in South Africa.”Arendse says that fighting her first major fire in Noor-dhoek was a challenging but highly rewarding experience. “It was my first full 24-hour shift and the first time we were working with all the other male firefighters. It was tiring and very hot in our protective gear but we finished the job and the feeling afterwards was very rewarding.”Arendse encourages the women of South Africa to never underestimate them-selves. “Don’t be defined by what people say you can and can’t do.”  vAugust 2020 Edition 1 WOMEN'S MONTHCelebrating South African women Gender-based Violence and Femicide (GBVF) continues to be a big problem in our so-ciety.

Why do we celebrate Women’s Day? In South Africa, 9 August is Women's Day and the month of August is Nation-al Women’s Month. This is an opportunity to celebrate women’s achievements and the important role that wom-en of all races and religions have played and continue to play in South African society.On 9 August 1956, more than 20 000 women from all walks of life united in a mass demonstration at the Union Buildings in Pretoria. They protested against the unjust pass laws enforced on wom-en in South Africa.The women were led by Lil-ian Ngoyi – a trade unionist and political activist, Helen Joseph, Albertina Sisulu, and Sophia Williams-De Bruyn.In remembrance of what South African women achieved on that day, 9 Au-gust has been declared as National Women’s Day and is a public holiday in South Africa. Women’s Month is an opportunity to celebrate and reflect on the achieve-ments of these inspirational women, the problems they faced in the struggle to be free and the important role all women continue to play in society. Apart from their traditional roles as mothers, wives and caregivers, statistics show that women are making great progress in business, politics and academic and economic careers, with more and more women reaching top positions.Make a differenceWomen of South Africa, be proud of what you have achieved.
