Some people think that abstinence (choosing to not have sex until you are mar-ried) is old-fashioned, while others think it is morally the best thing to do. Teenagers, however, need to decide for themselves.Many people do not want to wait until they are mar-ried before having sex. They also do not want to rush into anything and make costly mistakes. They often decide that delaying having sex until they are older, more responsible, in a stable re-lationship with one partner and have a job, is the best thing to do.If you choose abstinence or delaying sex, there are other things you can do to protect yourself:
• Choose your friends care fully. Friends should want what is best for you and should respect your decision not to have sex.• Beware of situations that could be unsafe, like friends drinking or taking drugs, that could lead to unsafe sex.• Beware of partners who claim that you will sleep with them if you love them.• Listen to and learn from those who have gone through teenage pregnancy. They know the mistakes and disadvantages.• Listen to and learn from your parents about their life experiences. If you decide that absti-nence and delaying sex are not the best decisions for you and you would rather not wait, take the time to learn about protection, including contraception, which is using a method (mechanical or chemical) to prevent pregnancy. There are various con-traceptives that work in different ways, but they are all designed to prevent pregnancy. They include oral contraception, known as ‘the pill’; injectable con-traception; and male and female condoms.
What can I do if I’m pregnant?If you think you might be pregnant, take someone you trust with you to your nearest clinic to have a preg-nancy test.Antenatal care (taking care of the unborn baby) is important and usually starts at eight weeks. Your local clinic can help you with antenatal care and a healthcare worker will as-sist you to develop a plan that is suitable for you and your baby.If you are pregnant, it is important to eat healthy nutritious food, exercise, get enough sleep and avoid drugs and alcohol.

FALLING PREGNANT when you are a teenager will affect the rest of your life, but there are ways to keep yourself safe from an unplanned pregnancy.
Applicants urged to appeal rejected R350 claimsThe South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) has urged people to send through their appeals after experiencing an increased number of reject ed applications for the R350 COVID-19 grant.
According to the agency, this is attributed to several factors such as incorrect de-tails provided by South Afri-cans who were applying for the grant and information received from institutions such as the Unemployment Insurance Fund and South African Revenue Service databases.Meanwhile, SASSA said it saw another spike in declined applications in August after it introduced an additional step in the form of a means test. “This was done to ensure that the requirement for ap-plicants to have no income was met,” SASSA explained.However, following engagement with the Department of Social De-velopment, parties agreed to reconsider the use of the means test through the banks as a criterion to deter-mine eligibility. “This will affect the ap-proximately 1.9 million people, who have been receiving the grant to date but who were declined in August,” SASSA said.An Auditor-General report recently identified about  30 000 undeserving appli-cants, who received the grant while not meeting the qualifying criteria.  “In response to this find-ing, SASSA reviewed and strengthened its controls with regard to the evalu-ation of applications,” the agency said.SASSA said applications are now considered on their merits on a month-to-month basis, meaning that an ap-plication can be approved for one month and rejected the following month if, for instance, their financial sit-uation changed. “This has become more prevalent with the lock-down levels easing, allow-ing for some sectors of the economy to return to work, and thus reducing the num-ber of severely distressed citizens.”However, despite the re-duced levels of lockdown, SASSA said it was cog-nisant that the pandemic had taken its toll and many people were still without an income. “All applicants whose ap-plications are declined have the right to appeal against the decision," SASSA said, adding that it is currently dealing with about 60 000 appeals.
