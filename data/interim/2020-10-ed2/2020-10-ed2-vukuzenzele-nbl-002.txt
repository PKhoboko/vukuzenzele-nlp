7Vuk’uzenzele USewula 2020 umGadangiso 2 OKUMUMETHWEKOKungavikelwa Bunjani Ukuba Sidisi KwelutjhaKuneendlela ezi hlukileko zoku vikela ukuba sidisi kwamatlawana, ezifaka hlangana ukukhetha ukungayi emse meni ukufikela lapho wenda khona namkha nasele ukulungele ukuba nabentwana.
Abanye abantu badlumbana bona ukuzithiba (ukukhetha ukungayi emse-meni ukufikela lapho benda khona) kusikade, kanti-ke abanye bayakwenyula njengendlela engcono  etjengisa ukuziphatha kuh-le. Nanyana kunjalo, kufuze amatlawana  azithathele isiquntweso ngokwawo.Abantu abanengi abafu-ni ukulinda ukungena emtjhadweni ngaphambi kokuya emsemeni. Abafu-ni godu ukurhabela izinto ngalokho-ke bagcine sebenze iimphoso ezikulu. Kanengi vane baqunte ngokuriyadisa ukuya emsemeni bebabe bakhulu, bakghone ukuziphendule-la, babe nobudlelwano bezethando obunzinzileko nomlingani munye begodu nasele basebenza, kuyinto engcono khulu.Nawukhetha ukuzithiba namkha ukuriyadisa ukuya emsemeni, kunezinye izinto ongazenza ukuzivikela:
• Khetha ngokuyelela aba ntu ofuna babe bangani bakho. Kufuze abangani bakufisele okuhle ngaso soke isikhathi begodu kufuze bahloniphe isiqunto sakho sokungayi emsemeni.• Yelela ubujamo obungaba ngobungakaphephi, nje ngabangani abaselako namkha abasebenzisa iindakamizwa, oku ngadosela ekutheni uye emsemeni ngendlela  engakaphephi.• Khambela kude nomli ngani okukatelela bona ukuya naye emsemeni ku sitjengiso sethando lakho.• Lalela bewufunde kilabo ababasidisi basese matlawana. Bayazazi iimphoso zabo neenkhisi abarhohlomela kizo.• Lalela ababelethi bakho begodu ufunde emlandweni wamaphilo wabo nabasakhulako.
Nawuqunta bonyana uku-zithiba nokuriyadisa ukuya emsemeni akusizo iinqunto ezikufaneleko nezingcono begodu awufuni ukulinda, zinikele isikhathi ufunde ngokuzivikela, okufaka hlangana iinkhandelambe-leko, okukusebenzisa indle-lathize (isikhandelambeleko esifakwa hlangana neqanda nembewu, ipilisi nofana  ikhondomu) ukuvikela ukuba sidisi. Kuneenkhandelambeleko ezisebenza ngeendlela ezi-hlukileko, kodwana zoke zenzelwe ukuvikela imbe-leko. Zifaka hlangana isivikelambeleko esiselwako, esaziwa ngokuthi ‘lipilisi’, isikhandelambeleko esimjo-vo namakhondomu wabantu bembaji newebengubo.
Khuyini Engingakwenza Nasele Ngisidisi?Nawusola bonyana usidisi, khamba nomuntu omthembako emtholapilo oseduze uyokuhlolelwa ukuba sidisi.Itjhejo lomuntu osidisi (ukutlhogonyelwa komntwana ongakabukube-lethwa) kuqakathekile begodu kuthoma ngeveke yobunane. Umtholapilo wangekhenu ungakusiza ngetjhejo lomuntu osidisi begodu umsebenzi wezamaphilo uzokusiza ukutla-ma ihlelo elivumelana nawe nomntanakho.Nawusidisi, kuqakathekile ukugoma imivango enezakhamzimba, ukuthabulula umzimba, ukula-la ngokwaneleko nokuzila iindakamizwa notjwala.

UKUBA SIDISI lokha nawusese litlawana kuzokuba nomthelela omumbi epilweni yakho yoke, nokho zikhona iindlela zokobana uvikele ukuba sidisi okungakahlelwa.
Applicants urged to appeal rejected R350 claimsThe South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) has urged people to send through their appeals after experiencing an increased number of rejected applications for the R350 COVID-19 grant.
According to the agency, this is attributed to several factors such as incorrect de-tails provided by South Afri-cans who were applying for the grant and information received from institutions such as the Unemployment Insurance Fund and South African Revenue Service databases.Meanwhile, SASSA said it saw another spike in declined applications in August after it introduced an additional step in the form of a means test. “This was done to ensure that the requirement for ap-plicants to have no income was met,” SASSA explained.However, following engagement with the Department of Social De-velopment, parties agreed to reconsider the use of the means test through the banks as a criterion to deter-mine eligibility. “This will affect the ap-proximately 1.9 million people, who have been receiving the grant to date but who were declined in August,” SASSA said.An Auditor-General report recently identified about 30 000 undeserving applicants, who received the grant while not meeting the qual-ifying criteria.  “In response to this find-ing, SASSA reviewed and strengthened its controls with regard to the evalu-ation of applications,” the agency said.SASSA said applications are now considered on their merits on a month-to-month basis, meaning that an ap-plication can be approved for one month and rejected the following month if, for instance, their financial sit-uation changed. “This has become more prevalent with the lock-down levels easing, allow-ing for some sectors of the economy to return to work, and thus reducing the num-ber of severely distressed citizens.”However, despite the re-duced levels of lockdown, SASSA said it was cog-nisant that the pandemic had taken its toll and many people were still without an income. “All applicants whose ap-plications are declined have the right to appeal against the decision," SASSA said, adding that it is currently dealing with about 60 000 appeals.
