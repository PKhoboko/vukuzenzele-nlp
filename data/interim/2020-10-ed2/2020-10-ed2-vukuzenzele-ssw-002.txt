7Vuk’uzenzele Imphala 2020 Lushicilelo 2 LOKUVAMILEUngakuvikela njani kukhulelwa kwelushaKunetindlela letinengi letehlukahlukene tekuvikela kukhule lwa kwelusha, letifa ka ekhatsi kukhetsa kungayi ecansini kute kube sikhatsi lapho sewusemshadweni noma sewukulungele kuba nebantfwana.
Labanye bantfu bacabanga kutsi kutitsiba (kukhetsa kungayi ecansini kute kube sikhatsi lapho sewusemshadweni) kuyintfo yakudzala, kantsi labanye bacabanga kutsi kuyindlela lekahle yekutiphatsa longayilandzela. Lusha, noma kunjalo, kufuneka lutitsatsele sincumo.Bantfu labanengi abafuni kulindza baze bangene  emshadweni ngembi  kwekuya ecansini. Abafuni futsi kujaka kwenta tintfo bese benta emaphutsa labita kakhulu. Bavamise kutsatsa sincumo seku-hlehlisa sikhatsi sekuya ecansini bate babe badzala, sebakwati kuba nesibopho kakhulu, sebanebudlelwane betelutsandvo lobusimeme nemlingani munye futsi se-basebenta, kuyintfo lekahle kakhulu lebangayenta.Uma ukhetsa kutitsiba noma kuhlehlisa sikhatsi sekuya ecansini, kukhona letinye tintfo longatenta kute utivikele:
• Khetsa bangani bakho ngekucophelela. Bangani kufuneka bafune ukutfole loko lokukahle kakhulu kuwe futsi kufuneka basihloniphe sincumo sakho sekungayi ecansini.• Caphela timo letingahle tibe nekungaphephi, njengebangani labanatsako noma labasebe ntisa tidzakamiva, leti ngakuholela ekutsini uye ecansini ngendlela lengakaphephi.• Caphela tingani letitakutjela kutsi kufuneka ulale nato uma ubatsandza.• Lalela futsi ufundze kulabo lesebayihambile lendlela yekukhulelwa basesebasha. Bayawati emaphutsa nebubi baloko.• Lalela futsi ufundze kuba tali bakho mayelana na loko labahlangabetene nako emphilweni.
Uma utsatsa sincumo sekutsi kutitsiba nekuhle-hlisa kuya ecansini akusito tincumo letikahle lotitsetse letikufanele futsi ubona kuncono kutsi ungalindzi, tinike sikhatsi sekufundza ngekutivikela, lokufaka ekhatsi kuvikela kukhule-lwa, lokusebentisa indlela (yemshini noma yemakhemikhali) kute uvikele kukhulelwa.Kunetivikelakukhulelwa letehlukene tekuvikela kukhulelwa letisebenta ngetindlela letehlukene, kodvwa tonkhe tentelwe kuvikela kukhulelwa. Tifa-ka ekhatsi tivikelakukhulelwa letinatfwako, lokwa-tiwa ngekutsi “liphilisi”; tivikelakukhulelwa letingumjovo; nemakhondomu alabadvuna newalabasikati.
Yini lengingayenta uma ngikhulelwe?Uma usola kutsi kungenteka kutsi ukhulelwe, hamba ne-muntfu lometsembako niye emtfolamphilo losedvute uyohlolwa kukhulelwa. Kunakekelwa ngembi kwekubeleka (kunakekelwa kwemntfwana losengakabelekwa) kumcoka futsi kuvamise kucala emavikini lasiphohlongo. Umtfolamphilo wangakini ungakusita ngekunakekelwa ngembi kwekubeleka futsi sise-benti setemphilo sitakusita kucala luhlelo lolulungele wena nemntfwana wakho.Uma ukhulelwe, kuba-lulekile kutsi udle kudla lokunemphilo nalokunemsoco, utivocavoce, ulale ngalokwenele bese ugwema tidzakamiva netjwala.

KUKHULELWA USASEMUSHA
kutawubanemtselela emphilweni yakho yonkhe, kodvwa kunetindlela letingakugcina uvikelekile kute ungatitfoli sewukhulelwe ungakatilungiseleli.
Applicants urged to appeal rejected R350 claimsThe South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) has urged people to send through their appeals after experiencing an increased number of rejected applications for the R350 COVID-19 grant.
According to the agency, this is attributed to several factors such as incorrect de-tails provided by South Afri-cans who were applying for the grant and information received from institutions such as the Unemployment Insurance Fund and South African Revenue Service databases.Meanwhile, SASSA said it saw another spike in declined applications in August after it introduced an additional step in the form of a means test. “This was done to ensure that the requirement for ap-plicants to have no income was met,” SASSA explained.However, following engagement with the Department of Social De-velopment, parties agreed to reconsider the use of the means test through the banks as a criterion to deter-mine eligibility. “This will affect the ap-proximately 1.9 million people, who have been receiving the grant to date but who were declined in August,” SASSA said.An Auditor-General report recently identified about 30 000 undeserving applicants, who received the grant while not meeting the qual-ifying criteria.  “In response to this find-ing, SASSA reviewed and strengthened its controls with regard to the evalu-ation of applications,” the agency said.SASSA said applications are now considered on their merits on a month-to-month basis, meaning that an ap-plication can be approved for one month and rejected the following month if, for instance, their financial sit-uation changed. “This has become more prevalent with the lock-down levels easing, allow-ing for some sectors of the economy to return to work, and thus reducing the num-ber of severely distressed citizens.”However, despite the re-duced levels of lockdown, SASSA said it was cog-nisant that the pandemic had taken its toll and many people were still without an income. “All applicants whose ap-plications are declined have the right to appeal against the decision," SASSA said, adding that it is currently dealing with about 60 000 appeals.
