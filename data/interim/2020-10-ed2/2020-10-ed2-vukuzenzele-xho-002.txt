Applicants urged to appeal rejected R350 claimsThe South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) has urged people to send through their appeals after experiencing an increased number of rejected applications for the R350 COVID-19 grant.
According to the agency, this is attributed to several factors such as incorrect de-tails provided by South Afri-cans who were applying for the grant and information received from institutions such as the Unemployment Insurance Fund and South African Revenue Service databases.Meanwhile, SASSA said it saw another spike in declined applications in August after it introduced an additional step in the form of a means test. “This was done to ensure that the requirement for ap-plicants to have no income was met,” SASSA explained.However, following engagement with the Department of Social De-velopment, parties agreed to reconsider the use of the means test through the banks as a criterion to deter-mine eligibility. “This will affect the ap-proximately 1.9 million people, who have been receiving the grant to date but who were declined in August,” SASSA said.An Auditor-General report recently identified about 30 000 undeserving applicants, who received the grant while not meeting the qual-ifying criteria.  “In response to this find-ing, SASSA reviewed and strengthened its controls with regard to the evalu-ation of applications,” the agency said.SASSA said applications are now considered on their merits on a month-to-month basis, meaning that an ap-plication can be approved for one month and rejected the following month if, for instance, their financial sit-uation changed. “This has become more prevalent with the lock-down levels easing, allow-ing for some sectors of the economy to return to work, and thus reducing the num-ber of severely distressed citizens.”However, despite the re-duced levels of lockdown, SASSA said it was cog-nisant that the pandemic had taken its toll and many people were still without an income. “All applicants whose ap-plications are declined have the right to appeal against the decision," SASSA said, adding that it is currently dealing with about 60 000 appeals.
