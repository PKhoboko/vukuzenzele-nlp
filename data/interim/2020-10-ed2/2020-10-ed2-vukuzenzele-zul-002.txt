7Vuk’uzenzele Mfumfu 2020 Ushicilelo 2 OKUQUKETHWEKungavikelwa kanjani ukukhule lwa kwabesifazane abasebancaneZiningi izindle la zokuvikela ukuthi abesifazane abasebancane bangakhulelwa, lokhu kubandakanya uku khetha ukungazibanda kanyi ocansini kuze kube uyashada noma usukulungele ukuba nezingane.
Abanye abantu bacabanga ukuthi ukuzilwa kocansi (ngokukhetha ukungazi-bandakanyi ocansini kuze kube uyashada) isidala leso, ngenkathi abanye becabanga ukuthi kuyiyonanto elungile ukuthi yenziwe. Abesifazane abasebancane, noma kunjalo, kumele ba-zithathele bona izinqumo ngokwabo.Abantu abaningi abafuni ukulinda kuze kube baya-shada ukuze benze ucansi. Abafuni futhi ngokunjalo ukujaha izinto kanye nokwenza amaphutha anzi-ma. Bavama ukunquma ukuzibambezela ekwenzeni ucansi kuze kushaye isikhathi sokuthi babe bada-la ngokwanele, bakwazi ukulandela izibophezelo, babe sebudlelwaneni obu-mileyo nomuntu oyedwa kanye nokuthi basebenze, kuyiyonanto elungile uku-yenza.Uma ukhetha ukungazibandakanyi noma uku-zibambezela kwezocansi, zikhona ezinye izinto  ongazenza ukuzivikela:
• Khetha abangani bakho ngokucophelela.Aba ngani abazokufunela oku hle futhi abazosihlonipha isinqumo sakho soku ngazibandakanyi ocansini.• Qaphela izimo oku ngenzeka ukuthi zinga bi nokuphepha, njenga bangani abaphuza noma abadla izidakamizwa,  ezingakuholela ocansini olungaphephile.• Qaphela abantu othandana nabo abathi uzolala nabo uma ubathanda.• Lalela futhi ufunde kulabo besifazane abasebancane abake bakhulelwa. Bayazi ngalawo maphutha kanye nobubi bakhona.• Lalela futhi ufunde kubazali bakho ngezimo aba bhekane nazo empilweni. Uma unquma ukuthi ukungazibandakanyi kanye nokuzibambezela kwezocansi izinqumo ezi ngakulungele futhi angeke ukwazi ukulinda, zinike isikhathi ufunde ngoku zivikela, okubandakanya ukuvikela ukukhulelwa, lokhu okusebenzisa indlela (yomshini noma yezithako zamakhemikhali) zokuvikela ukukhulelwa.
Kunenqwaba yezindlela zokuvikela ukukhulelwa ezisebenza ngezindlela ezehlukene, kodwa zonke zakhiwelwe ukuvikela ukukhulelwa. Zibanda-kanya izinto zokuvikela ukukhulelwa eziphuzwa ngowesifazane, ezaziwa ‘njengephilisi eliyisivike-la kukhulelwa’; umjovo wokuvikela ukukhulelwa; kanye namakhondomu abesilisa nabesifazane.Yini engingayenza uma ngikhulelwe?Uma kwenzeka ucabanga ukuthi ukhulelwe, hamba nomuntu omethembayo niye emtholampilo ose-duzane uyohlolelwa uku-khulelwa.Unakekelo lokhulelwe (lunakekela umntwana  engakazalwa) kanti lubalulekile kakhulu futhi luqala uma lowo okhule-lwe esenamaviki ayisishi-yagalombili okukhulelwa. Umtholampilo wangakini uzokusiza ngonakekelo lokhulelwe futhi umse-benzi wezempilo uzokusiza ukuthi uthuthukise uhlelo olulungele wena kanye nomntwana wakho.Uma ukhulelwe, kubalulekile ukuthi udle uku-dla okunempilo kanye nomsoco, uzivocavoce, ulale ngokwanele kanye nokugwema izidakamizwa kanye notshwala.
*Lolu lwazi niluhlinzekwa nguMnyango Wezempilo KwaZulu-Natal.
UKUKHULELWA USEMNCANE  kuzomosha impilo yakho yonke, kodwa-ke zikhona izindlela zokuzigcina uphephile ekukhulelweni okungahlelelwe.
Applicants urged to appeal rejected R350 claimsThe South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) has urged people to send through their appeals after experiencing an increased number of rejected applications for the R350 COVID-19 grant.
According to the agency, this is attributed to several factors such as incorrect de-tails provided by South Afri-cans who were applying for the grant and information received from institutions such as the Unemployment Insurance Fund and South African Revenue Service databases.Meanwhile, SASSA said it saw another spike in declined applications in August after it introduced an additional step in the form of a means test. “This was done to ensure that the requirement for ap-plicants to have no income was met,” SASSA explained.However, following engagement with the Department of Social De-velopment, parties agreed to reconsider the use of the means test through the banks as a criterion to deter-mine eligibility. “This will affect the ap-proximately 1.9 million people, who have been receiving the grant to date but who were declined in August,” SASSA said.An Auditor-General report recently identified about 30 000 undeserving applicants, who received the grant while not meeting the qual-ifying criteria.  “In response to this find-ing, SASSA reviewed and strengthened its controls with regard to the evalu-ation of applications,” the agency said.SASSA said applications are now considered on their merits on a month-to-month basis, meaning that an ap-plication can be approved for one month and rejected the following month if, for instance, their financial sit-uation changed. “This has become more prevalent with the lock-down levels easing, allow-ing for some sectors of the economy to return to work, and thus reducing the num-ber of severely distressed citizens.”However, despite the re-duced levels of lockdown, SASSA said it was cog-nisant that the pandemic had taken its toll and many people were still without an income. “All applicants whose ap-plications are declined have the right to appeal against the decision," SASSA said, adding that it is currently dealing with about 60 000 appeals.
