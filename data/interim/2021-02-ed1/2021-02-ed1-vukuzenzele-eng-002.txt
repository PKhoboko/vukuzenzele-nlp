February 2021 Edition 1HEALTHBusting the mythsAllison CooperPeople with albi nism do die. They do not have superpowers. Their blood can’t heal others and their body parts will not make you rich.
“They also do not repre-sent an ancestor,” says Dr Khensani Ngobeni-Mkize, a Mbombela-based specialist dermatologist (skin doctor).“Albinism is a group of inherited genetic disorders in which there is reduced or no melanin production in the skin, hair and eyes,” she adds.Melanin is the pigment that gives human skin, hair and eyes their colour.“The only difference be-tween a person with albinism and person without it, is the lack of colour. Due to reduced melanin, they have problems with their eyesight and prefer being in the shade because they are sensitive to the sun,” says Dr Ngobeni-Mkize.There are two forms of albi-nism, oculocutaneous (affects the skin and eyes) and ocular (affects eyes only).Dr Ngobeni-Mkize urges parents of children with albi-nism to empower their child. “See an eye specialist, make sure they get a proper edu-cation, encourage them and help educate the community about albinism. This is very important to stop the stigma-tisation and discrimination.”Sun protection is vitalMelanin is important because it creates colour in the skin, hair and eyes, which protects them against the damaging rays of the sun.It’s vital that people with albinism protect themselves from the sun to avoid skin cancer. A skin sore could be cancer if it changes, grows, bleeds, will not heal, or is painful or itchy. They should also have their skin checked every six months and have their eyes checked by an eye doctor, who can provide them with glasses that can improve, but not cure, their eyesight.Protect yourself from the sun by:
• Wearing a broad-brimmed hat.• Wearing a light scarf or shirt with a collar to pro-tect the neck.• Applying broad-spectrum sunscreen, with UVB and UVA protection, that con-tains minerals and is water resistant. Apply sunscreen 20 minutes before sun ex-posure and re-apply fre-quently.• Avoiding the sun between 10am and 3pm.• Drinking water.• Eating a well-balanced diet.Parenting a child with epilepsyAllison CooperWhile it may be a shock for a family to learn that a child has epilepsy, you can build an understanding, loving and accepting environment in which your child can grow and believe in their ability to succeed.
According to Epilepsy South Africa, parents could be concerned about their child’s future and find epilep-sy difficult to accept or talk about. You may feel angry, depressed, inadequate and guilty, but you can overcome these feelings and your anx-iety by educating yourself about the condition.Epilepsy is the tendency to have recurrent seizures, which occur when there is an abnormal electrical discharge in the brain.
Why my child?Understanding epilepsy and why seizures occur doesn’t explain why this happened to your child.In approximately 66% of cases, the underlying cause of epilepsy is unknown. This is referred to as idiopathic ep-ilepsy. In the remaining cases the underlying causes can be identified, which is known as symptomatic epilepsy. There can be a variety of underlying causes such as a head injury, that can occur at any age; a birth injury, such as a lack of oxygen during birth; fever convulsions, encephali-tis, meningitis or childhood measles; and metabolic or biochemical disturbances or imbalances.A doctor will prescribe medication based on the age, physical condition and type of seizures your child has. Remember, anti-convulsant medication does not cure epilepsy but, in most cases, will reduce the frequency and severity of seizures.Some tips on parenting a child with epilepsy:
• Make your child aware of the condition. Children as young as three can understand that the brain controls the body. Older children should be given a more comprehensive explanation.• Inform close relatives and your child’s friends, teachers and other responsible school officials. • Ensure your child receives a comprehensive medical assessment by a qualified professional, ideally a neurologist.• Emphasise your child’s abilities and any activity that will improve their self-acceptance, self-worth and self-confidence. • Ensure adult supervision for some activities, such as swimming.• Ensure medication is administered and taken reg ularly as prescribed.• Provide a set routine with plenty of rest, three balanced meals per day and regular exercise.• When explaining seizures use words that your child will understand.• Never allow your child to use seizures as an excuse for getting out of chores or accepting responsibility.
