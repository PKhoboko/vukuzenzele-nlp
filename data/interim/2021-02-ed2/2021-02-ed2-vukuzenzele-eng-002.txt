February 2021 Edition 2COVID-19 vaccine: What you need to knowAllison CooperWith South Afri ca’s mass Coro navirus Disease (COVID-19) vaccination programme rolling out for healthcare workers in February, Vuk’uzenzele sheds some light on what the COVID-19 vaccine is, how it works and why it’s so important to stop the spread of the virus.
What does a vaccine do?A vaccine trains your body’s immune system (which fights infection), to produce antibodies (proteins that fight disease) – exactly like it would if you were exposed to a virus.
Why is the vaccine so important?Being vaccinated against COVID-19 is an effective way to protect yourself against the virus because your risk of infection is reduced. You are then less likely to pass the virus on to someone else.The aim of vaccination is to reach herd immunity – when enough of the population is immune to the virus it provides indirect protection to those who aren’t immune, bringing the spread of the virus under control.
Are vaccines necessary to prevent the spread of COVID-19?There is overwhelming scientific evidence that vaccination is the best defence against serious infections.Will the vaccine stop me from getting COVID-19?No vaccine provides 100% protection. Herd immunity also does not provide full protection to those who are not vaccinated. However, with herd immunity, these people will have substantial protection.
Is the vaccination safe?COVID-19 vaccines go through a demanding, multi-stage testing process, including large trials that involve tens of thousands of people.Every vaccine used in South Africa’s mass vaccination programme has to be approved by the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority. The Oxford University-AstraZeneca vaccine has already been approved by various regulators around the world and is being rolled out in other countries.
Who will get the vaccine first?The country’s estimated 1.25 million healthcare workers will receive the vaccine first. In Phase Two, essential workers such as teachers, police, municipal workers, taxi drivers and other frontline personnel; people in institutions such as old age homes, shelters and prisons; and people over 60 and adults with co-morbidities will be prioritised.In Phase Three, about 22.5 million of the remaining adult population will be vaccinated. The target is to vaccinate 67% of the population by the end of 2021. By then we should reach herd immunity.
Who is purchasing the vaccine?Government is the sole pur chaser of vaccines and will distribute them to provincial governments and the private sector.All those who are vaccinated will be placed on a national register and provided with a vaccination card.HEALTHThis information was supplied by the Department to Health.www.sacoronavirus.co.zaCOVID-19 vaccines  arrive in SAAllison CooperSouth Africa’s fight against the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) took a big step forward with the arrival of one million AstraZeneca vaccines (Covishield), manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII) recently.
South Africa’s fight against the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) took a big step forward with the arrival of one million AstraZeneca vaccines (Covishield), manufac tured by the Serum Institute of India (SII) recently.President Cyril Ramaphosa that received the vaccines at the OR Tambo International Airport.“Now that the vaccines have arrived, they will be tested at the National Control Laboratory to confirm that their integrity has been maintained during transportation. After testing, they will be distributed across the country to thousands of our healthcare workers who every day put their own lives at risk to save others,” says President Ramaphosa.The distribution of vaccines to healthcare workers is phase one of South Africa’s mass COVID-19 vaccination programme.The National Department of Health will coordinate the vaccine rollout with provincial health departments and the private healthcare sector.“Provincial health departments have submitted their distribution plans and we have identified about 200 facilities to which the vaccines can be distributed,” the President says.No-one will pay for their vaccination. The cost will either be covered by a person’s medical aid or by the State.President Ramaphosa says the vaccine will be available to all adults living in South Africa, regardless of their citizenship or residence status. While encouraging citizens to get vaccinated, he also stressed that no one will be forced to take the vaccine. “Nobody will be forbidden from travelling, from enrolling at school, or from taking part in any public activity if they have not been vaccinat-ed. Nobody will be given this vaccine against their will, nor will the vaccine be administered in secret. Any rumours to this effect are both false and dangerous.”How to access the vaccine?The Department of Health has developed the Electronic Vaccine Data System (EVDS) to streamline the vaccine registration and rollout process. “This will allow us to capture all relevant data associ ated with the administration of the vaccine. The system allows a person to make an appointment as soon as they qualify for a vaccination, at the vaccine centre closest to them. The system will record vaccinations as they are administered,” President Ramaphosa explains.Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize launched the EVDS recently and urged all active healthcare workers to register on the portal (https://vac-cine.enroll.health.gov.za).
