Vuk’uzenzeleMay 2021 Edition 23 FROM THE UNION BUILDINGSRobust media more critical than everWe live in a country where not just journalists but any member of the public is able to freely articulate their views, their opinions and indeed their dissatisfaction without fear of retribution.
We have come a long way from the days where social protest by artists attracted banning orders, and critical reporting by journalists risked imprisonment or the closure of publications.Recently, the organisation Reporters without Borders published the 2021 World Press Freedom Index, a ba-rometer of the state of media freedom across the globe.Overall, it was found that there has been a decline in public access to information and an increase in obstacles to news coverage in a number of countries. The report said that jour-nalism is “totally blocked or seriously impeded” in 73 countries and “constrained” in 59 others. What is worrying is that media freedom has deterio-rated under the COVID-19 pandemic, with the various restrictions put in place having seemingly been used to curtail media activity in several places.In this latest report South Africa ranked 32nd out of 180 countries. The index describes the state of media freedom in South Africa as “guaranteed but fragile”. It notes that while the South African Constitution protects freedom and we have an established culture of investigative journalism, a number of impediments still hinder journalists in the performance of their duties. This includes legal injunc-tions against taking images of National Key Points or re-porting on matters involving state security. The report also notes an increase during 2020 of the intimidation of journalists, especially female journalists on social media. Such intimidation is totally unacceptable, but is par-ticularly harmful when it is directed at female journalists and is occasionally accom-panied by threats of sexual violence. This is a matter of great concern and cannot be allowed.At the same time, we take great comfort in the knowl-edge that we have a free, robust media that is able to report without fear or favour about those in power, about the most pressing social issues of our time, and to provide accurate, impartial information to the public.At a time when we are working together to rebuild our economy and our society in the midst of the Coronavi-rus pandemic, a robust media is more critical than ever. The South African media has played a pivotal role in uncovering much of what we know today about the true extent of capture of the state by self-serving, corrupt individuals and entities.They sustained their re-porting even in the face of intimidation, disinformation and attacks on their person.Corruption is by no means the only challenge we face as a country. The daily lives of many South Africans are still affected by poverty, inequal-ity and underdevelopment, poor service delivery and lack of access to opportunities. If the media is to remain true to its responsibility to support democracy, our journalists must continue to report without fear or favour on the other issues of the day. Their sustained coverage must include gender-based violence, crime in our com-munities and social ills like substance abuse. Our media should provide accurate and impartial infor-mation, enabling the public to make informed decisions, to access opportunities and to improve their lives. They should continue to produce journalism that goes beyond the headlines and front pages and that contrib-utes to human development. They should report both the good news and the bad news, the progress we make and the challenges we face. Credibility is key to sustain-ing trust between journalists and the public. When journalists allow themselves or their platforms to be used to fight political battles or settle scores on be-half of vested interests, their credibility suffers. When media disseminate stories that are inaccurate or that they know to be false, the public loses faith in them. It is in the best interests of all who love this country and wish for it to succeed that our media is supported, and not hindered in its work.  As a society, let us continue to work together to jealously safeguard our country’s me-dia freedom. It was hard won and without it, we cannot hope to flourish.
