December 2020 EditionHEALTHDrink water to avoid dehydrationAllison CooperSevere heat and not drinking enough fluids can lead to dehydration and heatstroke, which can be fatal.
According to the Western Cape Department of Health, the summer heat brings with it a high risk of dehydration, which is a harmful loss of water in the body.Dehydration is usually caused by not drinking enough liquids to replenish the water lost by sweating. It can also be caused by an illness, that causes vomiting or diarrhoea; and by sweating from a fever.The loss of body fluids does not only occur during hard physical activities, but can also result from walking, gardening or riding a bike, especially in hot or humid conditions.When you are dehydrated, your body cannot function as usual. Children younger than five, the elderly and people working outdoors are especially vulnerable to dehydration and heatstroke (a condition caused when your body overheats).Heatstroke is a medical emergency. Seek medical help immediately for any of these symptoms:
• Feeling confused or your speech starts to become slow and unclear.• Nausea and vomiting.• Rapid, shallow breathing.• Heart starts to race.• A throbbing headache.
Dehydration warning signsSome of the early warning signs of dehydration include:
• feeling thirsty and light-headed.• a dry mouth.• tiredness.• having dark coloured, strong-smelling urine.• passing urine less often than usual.To stay hydrated and avoid heatstroke you should:
• drink more water than you usually do on hot days.• stay inside or in shaded areas.• wear a wide rim hat or use an umbrella.• always carry a bottle of water with you and drink regularly.• take regular breaks from the sun if you work out-side. • cool yourself down by us-ing a spray bottle.
Babies and childrenParents and caregivers should pay extra attention to children and babies, to make sure they are hydrated. Breastfeeding moms should feed their babies more fre-quently when it is very hot.Keep children indoors or in the shade, dress them in light clothing and wipe them down with a damp cloth to help them stay cool. Remember to apply sunscreen when they go outdoors.If children younger than five have watery stools, keep vomiting and are tired, seek medical help immediately. Also seek immediate medical care if your baby is unable to breastfeed or has sunken eyes and a sunken soft spot (fontanelle) on its head.In children, other dehydration warning signs include:
• a dry or sticky mouth.• few or no tears when crying.• urinating less or fewer wet nappies than usual.• dry, cool skin.• irritability.• drowsiness or dizziness.
 vBe healthy this festive seasonThe festive season in South Africa is a time of soaking up the sun, enjoying a cold one with friends and feasting on delicious meals.
Unfortunately, many people overeat and eat unhealthy food over this time, which can pose health risks to a lot of people, especially those with already existing chronic conditions such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol or gout. To keep healthy, the Kwa-Zulu-Natal Department of Health advises the public to monitor what they eat as it may not always be good for their well-being.Making good choicesEating the correct amount of the correct kinds of foods will meet all of a person’s nutritional needs and boost resistance to diseases and stress. Do not eat lots of salt because it can cause high blood pressure.Although some health con-ditions are hereditary  and are passed from one generation to another, many ailments are caused by poor nutrition and a lack of exercise. Called ‘lifestyle diseases’, these in-clude heart conditions and high blood pressure which can result in heart attacks and strokes, diabetes, gall bladder complaints and liver, kidney and skin diseases.Eating a variety of foods that are not too fatty, too sweet or too salty, with enough fibre, will help keep you healthy. Your diet should include small portions of protein, such as meat, fish, chicken and eggs; dairy such as milk; good fibre from foods such as lentils and dried beans; and fruit and vegetables. Avoid fatty meat or oily food, sweetened foods, refined grain products such as white bread and large quantities of tea or coffee.You must also drink about eight glasses of water each day because water is essential to good health. It dilutes the urine and prevents kidney damage from a high con centration of waste p roducts.The effects of not following a healthy diet can include serious health consequences, such as obesity, which wors-ens other diseases and strains a person’s joints.Rather than binge eating at social gatherings, it is better to have three daily meals of more or less the same size.
 vGIVE YOURSELF the gift of good health this holiday period by watching what you eat.
