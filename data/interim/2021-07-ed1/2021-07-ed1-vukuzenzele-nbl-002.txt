Vuk’uzenzeleUV elabahlinze 2021 umGadangiso 17Good health by the cupfulAllison CooperTea farmworkers and their families, in remote parts of the Western Cape, now have access to healthcare closer to their homes, as a result of a mobile health service in the area.
The mobile clinic was lau nched by non-profit organi sation, the Pebbles Project, and Twinings, a United Kingdom-based tea company, to support around 800 farmworkers and their families on a number of rooibos tea farms in Clanwilliam and Citrusdal.
The mobile clinic conducts wellness screenings and provides routine health check-ups, primary healthcare support and over-the-counter health products. It will also conduct health and wellness workshops on topics such as family planning, maternal health, hygiene, TB, HIV/AIDS, substance abuse and lifestyle diseases.  Sophia Warner, the Chief Executive Officer of the Pebbles Project, says a lack of access to quality healthcare poses a major challenge for those working and living in farming communities in remote areas where Twinings sources rooibos tea.  “Many farmworkers do not receive regular health check-ups or the medical attention or information they need in time, and consequently suffer risks of more serious health conditions that could have been prevented if treated earlier.” A lack of information also contributes to health challenges which impacts the farmworkers' ability to work and care for their families.
“The goal of the project is to enable rooibos tea farmworkers to take control of their health and receive the medical support they need,” says Warner.
Albert Smit, from a farm in Jakkalvlei, says the farmworkers are grateful. “We are so happy… As a result of the service, we have less staff having to visit the local clinic and less absenteeism at work,” he adds.
The Pebbles Project’s part nership with Twinings is part of the company’s responsible sourcing programme called Sourced with Care.
Céline Gilart, the Head of Social Impact for Twinings, says Sourced with Care ensures that the company sources responsibly, but also acts as a force for good to improve the quality of life in communities from which it sources.
  vUkuthola imininingwana ngokuvikela ukutjha, ngena kubunzinzolwazi obuthiwww.childsafe.org.za Khandela Ukutjhiswa Mlilo EbusikaAllison CooperNjengombana  ubusika buza nesidingo sokufuna ukuzifuthumeza nje, lokho  kukhuphula amazinga wo bungozi bokulimala ngo kutjha okubangelwa ma khandlela, imililo, iintofu, iimfuthumezi ezinjengama-heater namanzi abilako.  “Isibalo sokulimala ngo-kutjha siyanda ngesikhathi sebusika begodu aba-belethi nabatlhogomeli babentwana kumele batjheje ngokupheleleko ukuqinise-kisa ukuphepha kwabo nekwabentwana babo”, kutjho uDorhodere u-Gary Dos  Passos. OyiKulu ye-Burns Unit esibhedlela i-Red Cross War Memorial Children’s Hospital (RCWMCH) begodu ulilunga labadosi phambili be-Burn Society of South Africa. Njengombana imililo ethoma kungakahloseki ingeze yabalekelwa nje, ukulimala ngokutjha kungavinjwa ngokuqaphela, ngokutlho-gomela kwabantu abadala begodu nangokuphepha. “Ukutjha ngelangabi kukulimala okumbi khulu okunomphumela weembazi ezihlala nomuntu ipilwakhe yoke begodu nokuhlungu-phazeka ngokomkhumbulo kibongazimbi nemindeni yabo,” kutjho uDorh Dos Passos. Ungakuvikela Bunjani Ukutjha Ukulimala ngokutjhiswa mlilo emakhaya kungavinjwa ngalindlela: ●	Beka	iinthoro	zomlilo,	ama-lighter, ama-accelerants (ipetroli nepharafeni), amakhandlela, igezi, na-malampa wepharafeni begodu nama-heater kude nalapha abentwana bafikelela khona. ●	Ungalahleli	ama-accelerants ngaphakathi kwelangabi. Lokho kuyingozi khulu. ●	Ungavumeli	abentwana badlalele eduze nepharafeni nofana amalampa wegezi nofana ama-heater. ●	Ungagugi	umntwana	usaphekile nofana ungasukeli abentwana bangakatjhejwa mumuntu ngephunyaneni/ngekhwitjhini nofana eduze nalo. ●	Qinisekisa	bona	iketlela	ikude. Thenga iketlela enganantambo nawukghonako. ●	Ungagugi	umgqomu	ofuthumeza amanzi (i-urn) nofana iimpoto ezinamanzi abilako eduze nabentwana. ●	Jikisa	iimbambo	zepoto	 uziqalise kude nangaphambili kwestofu. ●	Beka	amakhandlela	ngaphakathi kwebhodlelo lerhalasi elinehlabathi ngaphakathi ukuze na-kungenzeka awe awele ehlabathini bese ayacima.  ●	Ungacimi	imililo	ngehla-bathi. Umtjhiso uhlala ehlabathini ama-iri ambalwa. ●	Thoma	uthele	amanzi	amakhaza ebhavini, ngemva kwalokho uthele atjhi-sako. Zwelela amanzi wokuhlamba ngendololwana ngaphambi kokuwasebenzisa.
