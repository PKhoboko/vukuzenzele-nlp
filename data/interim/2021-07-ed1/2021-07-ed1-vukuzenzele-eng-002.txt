Vuk’uzenzeleJuly 2021 Edition 17Good health by the cupfulAllison CooperTea farmworkers and their families, in remote parts of the Western Cape, now have access to healthcare closer to their homes, as a result of a mobile health service in the area.
The mobile clinic was lau nched by non-profit organi sation, the Pebbles Project, and Twinings, a United Kingdom-based tea company, to support around 800 farmworkers and their families on a number of rooibos tea farms in Clanwilliam and Citrusdal.
The mobile clinic conducts wellness screenings and provides routine health check-ups, primary healthcare support and over-the-counter health products.
It will also conduct health and wellness workshops on topics such as family planning, maternal health, hygiene, TB, HIV/AIDS, substance abuse and lifestyle diseases.  Sophia Warner, the Chief Executive Officer of the Peb-bles Project, says a lack of access to quality healthcare poses a major challenge for those working and living in farming communities in remote areas where Twinings sources rooibos tea.  “Many farmworkers do not receive regular health check-ups or the medical attention or information they need in time, and consequently suffer risks of more serious health conditions that could have been prevented if treated earlier.”A lack of information also contributes to health challenges which impacts the farmworkers' ability to work and care for their families.
“The goal of the project is to enable rooibos tea farmworkers to take control of their health and receive the medical support they need,” says Warner.
Albert Smit, from a farm in Jakkalvlei, says the farmworkers are grateful. “We are so happy… As a result of the service, we have less staff having to visit the local clinic and less absenteeism at work,” he adds.
The Pebbles Project’s part nership with Twinings is part of the company’s responsible sourcing programme called Sourced with Care.
Céline Gilart, the Head of Social Impact for Twinings, says Sourced with Care ensures that the company sources responsibly, but also acts as a force for good to improve the quality of life in communities from which it sources.

“Burn injuries inc rease dramatically during winter and parents and caregivers need to be extra careful to ensure their own and their children’s safety,” says Doctor Gary Dos Passos.
He is the Head of the Burns Unit at the Red Cross War Memorial Children’s Hospital (RCWMCH) and an executive committee member of the Burn Society of South Africa.
While accidental fires are inevitable, many burn injuries can be prevented with vigilance, proper adult supervision and safer practices.
“Flame burns are devastat ing injuries with substantial lifelong physical and psychosocial consequences for the affected survivors and their families,” says Dr Dos Passos.
How to prevent burnsBurn injuries can be pre vented around the home. Here are some tips:
• Keep matches, lighters, accelerants (petrol and paraffin), candles, gas and paraffin lamps and heaters out of children’s reach. • Do not throw accelerants onto flames. This is extremely dangerous. • Do not let children play near paraffin or gas lamps or heaters. • Do not hold a child while cooking or leave children unsupervised in or near the kitchen.• Ensure the kettle is out of reach. Buy a cordless kettle if you can.• Do not carry urns or pots of boiling water around near children.• Turn pot handles away from the front of the stove.• Put candles in a deep glass bottle with sand at the bottom so that they will go out if they fall over.• Do not cover fires with sand. The heat stays in the sand for hours. • Put cold water in the bath first, and then add hot water. Always test the bath water with your elbow first.If you sustain a burn injury involving flames, stop, drop to the ground and roll to put out the flames.“Heat from a fire, hot water or electrical burn will continue to burn the tissue long after the contact is removed. “Stop the burning by keeping the burnt body part under cold running tap water for 20 minutes. Do not use ice, ice water, butter or any oil-based product on a burn,” says Dr Dos Passos.
