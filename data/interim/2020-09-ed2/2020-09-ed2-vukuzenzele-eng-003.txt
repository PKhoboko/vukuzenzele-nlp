5Vuk’uzenzele September 2020 Edition 2Court support  for GBV victimsMore Matshediso If you have suffered gender-based violence (GBV) and are in need of support at court, the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has a specialised service to assist you.
The Ke Bona Lesedi Court Preparation Programme is available at most Sexual Offences Courts and other courts that deal with GBV. Ke Bona Lesedi means ‘I see the light’ when translated from Setswana. A GBV victim can submit a request to the NPA for assis-tance. The senior public pros-ecutor or court preparation manager will then identify an appropriate court preparation officer to assist. “The service does not prom-ise a particular outcome in the case and each individ-ual’s experience is unique. Nonetheless, it assists with empowerment and restoring the victim’s dignity,” says a statement from the NPA. There are 161 court prepara-tion officers at various courts across the country. The service is one of vari-ous initiatives introduced by government to deal with the scourge of GBV. According to the NPA, the complainant, victim, survivor or witness will be contacted by a court preparation officer from the court where she or he will testify. The court preparation officer will be available to support the complainant at court and throughout the trial. Special-ised tools and techniques are used to visually show the victim that she or he is heard, protected and respected. Complainants can speak in their own language and the court preparation officer will ensure that the victim is referred for counselling or therapy, to complete their healing journey. Many women and children who have suffered GBV, for example, rape, are anxious about going to court to testify and relate intimate details of events in front of strangers. This service will help them feel more at ease.

This is according to Ntwa-gae Shuping, a social worker supervisor at Bophelong Psychiatric Hospital in the North West. He further defines the con-cept of divorce as the death of marriage and says it impacts on the people who are close to the couple, especially if the marriage two people in the marriage were committed to each other. Shuping says there are var-ious challenges that married people face in their union and sometimes they choose to divorcing instead of working things out. . He says the following issues could lead to divorce: • Spouses having different belief systems, which results in conflict.• Interfering or over-involved in-laws.• The inability to conceive children. • Different approaches or opinions to disciplining children. • Infidelity or having children out of wedlock.• Improper use of money. • Unhealthy sexual relationship between the couple.• Domestic violence.
“Divorce is not just the relational separation of the couple. It has emotional, mental, spiritual, financial and physical impacts on those involved. They also fear the unknown,” Shuping adds.Sometimes, once a divorce has been finalised, the divor-cees experience challenges that include fighting for cus-tody of the children, depres-sion and the loss of assets. Tips for a person who is going through divorce As a professional who some-times provides counselling to people who have been affect-ed by divorce, Shuping has a few tips for those who find it hard to accept the reality of being divorced.
• If you have done your best to salvage your marriage, honestly, let go.• Speak to the people who you trust and who value you, such as your support system.• Renew your strength and try to start a new life after divorce. • If you think you are the cause of the divorce, ask for forgiveness and forgive yourself too. • Allow yourself to go through all the stages of loss.• Guard against harbouring a grudge against your ex-partner. This grudge will slow down your healing. Harbouring a grudge will destroy future relationships if you want to remarry. • Leave the door open for reconciliation.
While getting a divorce ends a chapter in your life – and you will feel a range of emotions, from anger and loss to frustration and possibly relief – he says it is important to remember that it also signals a new beginning.
