3Vuk’uzenzele September 2020 Edition 2Protect our women and children  A year ago, almost to the day, thousands of wom en, men and children marched to Parliament to protest against a spate of rapes and killings of women and girls.
At the time, the nation was reeling from the murders of Uyinene Mrwetyana, Leighandre Jegels, Jesse Hess and a number of other wom-en who had lost their lives at the hands of brutal men.From all social backgrounds, young and old, students and working women, the peaceful protesters held aloft placards that read ‘Enough is Enough’ and ‘Am I next?’. The anguish and the anger was palpable that day. As I received their clearly articulated demands, it was clear to me that we needed to act urgently and with determination. It was important to me that I did not respond with hollow words and empty promises.A few days later, I called a joint sitting of Parliament, where we announced a R1.6 billion Emergency Response Action Plan to combat gender-based violence and femicide (GBVF).Over the six months of its implementation, public spending in various gov-ernment departments was reprioritised to support interventions for care and support for survivors, for awareness and prevention campaigns, to improve laws and policies, to promote the economic empowerment of women, and to strengthen the criminal justice system.And now we are on the cusp of the most far-reaching leg-islative overhaul in the fight against GBVF.Three key Bills relating to GBVF have been introduced in Parliament recently. Through the introduction of these Bills, we are honouring the promise we made to the protestors last year and to all the women of this country.The three amendment Bills are designed to fill the gaps that allow some perpetrators of these crimes to evade justice and to give full effect to the rights of our country’s women and children.These Bills, once finalised, will help to restore the confi-dence of our country’s wom-en that the law is indeed there to protect them. The first is the Bill to amend the Criminal Law (Sexual Of-fences and Related Matters) Amendment Act. This creates a new offence of sexual intim-idation, extends the ambit of the offence of incest, and extends the reporting duty of persons who suspect a sexual offence has been committed against a child.It expands the scope of the National Register for Sex Offenders (NRSO) to include the particulars of all sex offenders. Until now, it has only applied to sex offend-ers convicted of sex crimes perpetrated against children or persons with mental disa-bilities. The time an offend-er’s particulars must remain on the register has been increased, and those listed on the register will have to disclose this when they sub-mit applications to work with vulnerable persons. The Bill also provides for the names of persons on the NRSO to be publicly available.The Criminal and Related Matters Amendment Bill tightens, among others, the granting of bail to perpetra-tors of GBVF, and expands the offences for which minimum sentences must be imposed.The amendments impose new obligations on law-en-forcement officials and on our courts.When a prosecutor does not oppose bail in cases of GBV, they have to place their reasons on record. Unless a person accused of GBV can provide exceptional circum-stances why they should be released on bail, the court must order their detention until the criminal proceed-ings are concluded.In reaching a decision on a bail application, the courts are compelled to take a num-ber of considerations into ac-count. They include pre-trial reports on the desirability of releasing an accused on bail, threats of violence made against a survivor, and the view of the survivor regard-ing his or her safety.When it comes to parole, a complainant or a relative of a deceased victim must be able to make representation to the parole board. Given the unacceptably high levels of intimate partner violence in our country, we have tightened the provisions of the Domestic Violence Act. Domestic violence is now defined to cover those in engagements, dating, in cus-tomary relationships, and actual or perceived romantic, intimate or sexual relation-ships of any duration.The Bill also extends the definition of ‘domestic vio-lence’ to include the protec-tion of older persons against abuse by family members.Complainants will be able to apply for a protection order online. To prevent a scenario where perpetrators can hide past histories of domestic violence, an integrated repos-itory of protection orders will be established.The proposed amendments also oblige the departments of Social Development, Basic Education, Higher Education and Health to provide certain services to survivors where needed and to refer them for sheltering and medical care.The circumstances under which a prosecutor can refuse to institute a prose-cution when offences have been committed under the amended Act or to withdraw charges when it involves the infliction of bodily harm or where a weapon was used to threaten a complainant have been limited. In perhaps the most ground-breaking proposed amend-ment to the Act, if someone has knowledge, reasonable belief or suspicion that an act of domestic violence has been committed against a child, a person with disability or an older person and fails to report it to a social worker or police officer they can be fined and even imprisoned. Similarly, failure by a mem-ber of the SAPS to comply with their obligations under the Act will be regarded as misconduct and must be reported to the Civilian Sec-retariat for Police Service.The law is the one sure protector of all of society, but especially its most vulner-able. When diligently and fairly applied, it is the most powerful guarantor of justice.The women of South Af-rica have had enough of lukewarm actions that do not address one of the most fundamental rights of all – to live in freedom from fear.This government and its partners will make good by the women of South Africa. We will not let them down.FROM THE UNION BUILDINGS
