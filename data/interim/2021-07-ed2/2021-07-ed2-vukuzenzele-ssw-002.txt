Vuk’uzenzeleKholwane 2021 Lushicilelo 27 GENERALVikela Kuntjontjwa KwematisiKgaogelo LetsebeShenki Mabitsela (28) wati konkhe lokumayelana nekuntjo ntjwa kwematisi kanye nangemacala lamayelana naloko, njengoba ake waba muntfu lowahlukumeteka ngaloku.
Mabitsela, waseModimolle eLimpopo, wafaka sicelo sekuboleka imali ebhange ngeLweti lwemnyaka we-2020, kodvwa watjelwa kutsi sicelo sakhe angeke siphumelele ngoba unetikweleti letinengi. “Ngaya kuyofaka sicelo  sesikhatsi lesifishane sekubolekwa imali ngoba bengifuna kutiphilisa emva kwe-kutsi ngidzilitiwe emsebentini ngeNhlaba yemnyaka we-2020. Kwangimangalisa uma ngitjelwa kutsi angika-vumeleki.“Ekucaleni bengicabanga kutsi kungenca yekungabi nemholo losimeme, kodvwa bekungasiko loko. Bengati kutsi nginasinye kuphela sikweleti setimphahla futsi bengingenaso lesinye sikweleti, ngenca yaloko ngabese ngicela kutsi bangikhiphele imininingwane yami yetikweleti.”Mabitsela watfola kutsi unetinkhontileka letimbili tabomakhalekhikhini, kune-mali lebolekwe ebhange le-R65 000 netikweleti letinengi tasetitolo letivulwe ngeligama lakhe. Lesikweleti besicishe sifike ku-R100 000.“Ngembi kwekutsi kube nekuvalwa kwelive kwesi-gaba se-5, ngalahlekelwa ngumatisi wami, bengicabanga kutsi mhlawumbe use-ndzaweni letsite endlini futsi bengingakhatsateki kakhulu ngoba benginelikhadi lami lelisha lamatisi,” usho njalo.

Ngekuya kweTemisebenti Yekuvikela Kukhwabanisa TaseNingizimu Afrika (i-SAFPS) umbiko wekukhwabanisa wemnyaka we-2020, lomnyaka lowengcile kukhwabanisa kukhule ngema-161%  eMphumalanga Kapa kwakhula ngema-120% eGauteng.Manie van Schalkwyk, Umcondzisi Lomkhulu we-SAFPS utsi: “Intfo lekhatsata kakhulu kutsi kukhwabanisa lokumayelana nekutenta muntfu longasuye yena – lekwatiwa futsi ngekutsi kuntjontjwa kwemininingwane kukhule ngelizinga lelisabekako lelima-337%.”  Van Schalkwyk utsi bantfu kufuneka babike masinyane uma matisi noma ipasipoti yabo ilahlekile. “Kubika ngekulahlekelwa noma ngekuntjontjelwa ku-SAFPS naku-SAPS kwenta kutsi sikhone kufaka imininingwane ngekwe-elekthroniki nekwatisa emalunga etfu. Emva kwaloko atawubese ayachaphela kakhulu uma acinisekisa imininingwane yemuntfu.” 

Uma matisi wakho noma ipasipoti yakho ilahlekile, shayela i-SAFPS kule-nombolo letsi:  011 867 2234 noma utfumele incwadzigezi ku: protection@safps.org.za. Kufuneka futsi ushayele i-SAPS kulenombolo letsi: 08600 10111 noma uvakashele siteshi semaphoyisa le-sisedvute nawe. LOKUVAMILEKUVIMBELA KUTSI  imininingwane yakho intjontjwe, kumcoka kutsi ubike masinyane uma idokhumenti yakho yamatisi noma yepasipoti yebiwe.
Allison CooperA University of Pre toria (UP) com munity engage ment project is training students and community members to become beekeepers in Hatfield, Gauteng.
Six people are being trained to care for beehives that were discovered at Moja Gabedi, a UP community engagement project which was an unoffi-cial rubbish dump for about 100 years.Moja Gabedi was an un-sightly, empty lot in Festival Street, not far from the uni-versity’s Hatfield Campus. The university’s Commu-nity Engagement Unit  trans-formed the dumpsite into a shelter for the homeless, with lush gardens, vegetables, trees and flowing canals.“When we started clear-ing the site, we discovered bees deep underground in a corner of the plot. When the site was developed further, professional beekeepers were called in to relocate the bees into a hive,” says Gernia van Niekerk, Moja Gabedi’s Community Engagement Manager.While there was initially only one hive, three more have been added since June 2020. This presented an opportu-nity to train UP students and community members to care for the hives, and Mike Lang from Urban Bees offered to conduct a beekeeping course. Thanks to sponsors of protective gear and tools for beekeeping, the course was offered for free to two UP students, three commu-nity members and two urban farmers.They all attended an in-troductory class and were taught about bees, how a bee colony works, how to work with beekeeping equipment and safety practices. UP student Daddy Kgonothi says at first, he wasn’t really interested in bees.“When I learnt more, I understood that one should make the garden user-friend-ly for bees. If you know how to approach bees correctly, you’ll come to see that they are fascinating insects, he says.Community member Reckson Tshehla, who also attended the course, is keen to expand his knowledge about bees."It was the first time I saw a queen bee. I never thought I would get the opportunity to learn about bees."Moja Gabedi changed me. I experienced many things for the first time. Everything is so well organised," he says. Follow up training and practical classes will be con-ducted on colony manage-ment, managing diseases, honey production and pro-cessing, handling beeswax and pollen trapping. Those who complete the training will work with the site’s bees and get practical experience with Urban Bees.Bees make life sweeter at Moja Gabedi
