Vuk’uzenzeleNtulikazi 2021 Ushicilelo 27 GENERALGwema ukwebiwa kukamazisi Kgaogelo LetsebeU-Shenki Mabitse la (28) uyazi ka mhlophe ngokwe biwa kukamazisi kanye nobugebengu obuhlobene nakho, njengoba eseke waba yisisulu salesi senzo sobugebengu.
UMabitsela, odabuka endaweni yase-Modimolle e-Limpopo, wafaka isicelo semali-mboleko ebhange ngoLwezi kowezi-2020, kodwa watshelwa ukuthi ungene shi ezikweletini ngokwedlulele futhi aka fanelekile yimali-mboleko. “Ngangiyofuna imali-mboleko yesikhashana njengoba ngangifuna ukuhlanganisa impilo emva kokudilizwa emsebenzini ngoNhlangulana wangowezi-2020. Okwethusa kakhulu, ukuthi ngatshelwa ukuthi angifanelekile. “Ekuqaleni ngangicabanga ukuthi kungenxa yemali-ngeniso yami eyayingenazinzo, kodwa kwakungenja lo. Engangikwazi nje ukuthi nganginesikweletu esisodwa sezingubo zokugqoka futhi asikho esinye isikweletu esa sikhona, ngakho-ke ngabe sengicela ukuthi bangikhi phele imininingwane yezi kweletu zami,” kusho yena.UMabitsela wabona izinko ntileka zomakhalekhukhwi ni ababili, imali-mboleko ye bhange elinganiselwa kwizi 65 000 zamarandi kanye nenqwaba yezikweletu ezitolo ezivuliwe ngaphansi kwegama lakhe. Isikweletu sesisonke sasisondele kwizi100 000 zamarandi. “Ngaphambi nje kwesigaba  sesihlanu sokuvalwa kwe zwe, ngalahlekelwa Uma zisi wami. Bengilokhu ngi cabanga ukuthi kukhona la ucashe khona lapha endlini futhi bengingakhathazekile kakhulu ngoba benginomazisi wami wekhadi,” kusho yena.Ngemva kokubona ukuthi kukhona owenza izikweletu ngegama lakhe, uMabitsela wavula icala ngokwebiwa kukamazisi wakhe kuMbu tho Wamaphoyisa aseNingi zimu Afrika (i-SAPS). Kwakumele abhale incwadi efungelwe echaza kabanzi ngokulahleka kukamazisi wakhe futhi kwakumele ukuthi ayihambise kulabo okwakuvulwe izikweletu ngegama lakhe khona ukuze agweme ukungcoliswa kwegama lakhe ezimakethe. Lokhu okwahlangabezana noMabitsela akusiyo into entsha. Ngokombiko wezenkohlakalo wangowezi-2020 ohlanganiswe ngabasebenzi Bomsebenzi Wezokunqa ndwa Kwenkohlakalo eNi ngizimu Afrika (i-SAFPS), ngonyaka owedlule izi nga lenkohlakalo lenyuke lafinyelela kuma-161% eMpumalanga Kapa kanti futhi lafinyelela kuma-120% e-Gauteng. U-Manie van Schalkwyk, onguMqondisi Omkhulu kwi-SAFPS, uthi: “Okukha thaza kakhulu inkohlakalo eyenziwa ngegama lomunye umuntu – okubuye kwaziwe ngenkohlakalo kamazisi – futhi eseyinyuke ngokushaqisa ikhanda yafinyelela kuma-337%.” U-Van Schalkwyk uthi aba ntu kumele babike ngoku shesha ngomazisi noma ama phasiphothi alahlekile noma ebiwe. “Ukubika ngokulahlekile noma okwebiwe kwi-SAFPS kanye nakwi-SAPS kuqini sekisa ukuthi sifake imini ningwane yakho kwezo kugcinwa kwemininingwa ne yethu ngobuchwepheshe futhi sazise amalungu ethu ngalokho. Lokhu kwenza ukuthi baqaphelisise lapho beqinisekisa ngobunikazi bukamazisi.”  vUma ngabe umazisi wakho noma iphasiphothi ilahlekile noma yebiwe, shayela i-SAFPS kule nombolo ethi:  011 867 2234 noma ubathumelele  i-imeyili ku:  protection@safps.org.za. Ungaphinde ushayele i-SAPS kule nombolo ethi: 08600 10111 noma uvakashele esiteshini samaphoyisa esise-duzane nawe uku-yobazisa ngalokhu.EZINGUJIKELELEUKUGWEMA UKUBA  yisisulu sokwebelwa umazisi, kubalulekile ukubikwa ngokushesha kukamazisi noma iphasiphothi elahlekile noma eyebiwe.
Allison CooperA University of Pre toria (UP) com munity engage ment project is training students and community members to become beekeepers in Hatfield, Gauteng.
Six people are being trained to care for beehives that were discovered at Moja Gabedi, a UP community engagement project which was an unoffi-cial rubbish dump for about 100 years.Moja Gabedi was an un-sightly, empty lot in Festival Street, not far from the uni-versity’s Hatfield Campus. The university’s Commu-nity Engagement Unit  trans-formed the dumpsite into a shelter for the homeless, with lush gardens, vegetables, trees and flowing canals.“When we started clear-ing the site, we discovered bees deep underground in a corner of the plot. When the site was developed further, professional beekeepers were called in to relocate the bees into a hive,” says Gernia van Niekerk, Moja Gabedi’s Community Engagement Manager.While there was initially only one hive, three more have been added since June 2020. This presented an opportu-nity to train UP students and community members to care for the hives, and Mike Lang from Urban Bees offered to conduct a beekeeping course. Thanks to sponsors of protective gear and tools for beekeeping, the course was offered for free to two UP students, three commu-nity members and two urban farmers.They all attended an in-troductory class and were taught about bees, how a bee colony works, how to work with beekeeping equipment and safety practices. UP student Daddy Kgonothi says at first, he wasn’t really interested in bees.“When I learnt more, I understood that one should make the garden user-friend-ly for bees. If you know how to approach bees correctly, you’ll come to see that they are fascinating insects, he says.Community member Reckson Tshehla, who also attended the course, is keen to expand his knowledge about bees."It was the first time I saw a queen bee. I never thought I would get the opportunity to learn about bees."Moja Gabedi changed me. I experienced many things for the first time. Everything is so well organised," he says. Follow up training and practical classes will be con-ducted on colony manage-ment, managing diseases, honey production and pro-cessing, handling beeswax and pollen trapping. Those who complete the training will work with the site’s bees and get practical experience with Urban Bees.Bees make life sweeter at Moja Gabedi
