HEALTH Vuk’uzenzele3July 2021 Edition 2 FROM THE UNION BUILDINGSFROM THE UNION BUILDINGSSOEs must drive  economic growth  and transformationFor some years now, South Africa’s state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have mostly been associated in the public eye with state capture, financial mismanagement and inefficiency.
In addition to needing regular bailouts from government, some of the country’s biggest and most important state-owned com-panies have been struggling to meet their mandates. These SOEs should be at the forefront of economic and social transformation. They are responsible for providing the infrastructure and the services on which the economy depends, whether it be in the generation of elec-tricity, commuter transport, water provision, freight logis-tics or telecommunications.Our approach to state ownership is informed by the need for the effective functioning of key network industries, such as energy and ports, and by the need to ensure that the basic needs of all South Africans, particu-larly the poor, can be met. We firmly believe that public ownership is neces-sary in critical sectors of the economy and that the coun-try needs robust SOEs that are able to drive economic growth and transformation.This is particularly the case in the delivery of public goods such as electricity and water, where SOEs are able to pursue a developmental mandate in the public interest as opposed to a purely commercial one.That is why we have made it a priority of this government to turn these companies around to root out corruption, improve their governance and enable them to play the role they should in driving economic growth and employment creation.To this end, we have embarked upon a number of reforms to strengthen these SOEs so that they can produce the results that the country needs and expects. One of the most important reforms is in the energy sector. We have begun the process of restructuring Eskom into three different SOEs, responsible for gen-eration, transmission and distribution, respectively. This is because the previous structure of Eskom was ill-suited for a changing ener-gy landscape. It had become inefficient and costly and was not sufficiently transparent. The establishment of a trans-mission entity in particular will mean that Eskom will be able to purchase power from a broader range of providers, both private and public. This will improve transparency, increase competitiveness and promote the purchase of lowest-cost electricity. Through the Renewable Energy Independent Pow-er Producers Programme, there has been significant private investment in en-ergy generation. With the proposal to raise the licenc-ing exemption for embedded generation – where compa-nies produce electricity for themselves and other com-mercial users – from 1MW to 100MW, we can expect even more private investment. This is vital at a time when the country is suffering from severe and sustained electricity shortages and where neither Eskom nor the state is able to invest in new generation capacity.Importantly, these reforms will give Eskom the space to address its financial and operational challenges.Another critical reform is the establishment of the National Ports Au-thority as an independent subsidiary of Transnet.This a crucial part of Trans-net’s broader strategy to revi-talise our logistics infrastruc-ture. Transnet plans to invest R100 billion over the next five years in upgrading its infra-structure across the ports sys-tem. This will make our ports more efficient and our ex-ports more competitive, and benefit the entire economy.For the ordinary consumer, it will mean reduced prices in the long term for many of our goods. For our exporters, it will mean greater compet-itiveness in global markets.As our exports grow, our economy will expand and create more jobs. More efficient ports will make the entire economy work better – and as port volumes increase, jobs will be created at the ports themselves.Establishing the National Ports Authority as a Trans-net subsidiary with its own board will, among other things, mean that revenues generated by the ports can be used to replace old equipment and upgrade and expand our ports, work which has been delayed for more than a decade.  Among other things, these reforms will encourage great-er private investment in the country’s economic infra-structure. Some people have expressed concerns that this will diminish the importance or reduce the value of SOEs. In fact, the contrary is true.  These reforms will ensure that while strategic infra-structure remains firmly in state hands, our SOEs will become more efficient and the industries they support will become more competi-tive. Equally, these reforms are important to ensure that SOEs implement their broader developmental mandates to support all citizens and the economy. Our policy remains that SOEs must play a crucial developmental role in sup-porting the growth of our economy. Our task is to place them on a sound foot-ing, so that they can serve their ultimate shareholders – the South African people.
