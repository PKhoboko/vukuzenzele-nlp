Allison CooperA University of Pre toria (UP) com munity engage ment project is training students and community members to become beekeepers in Hatfield, Gauteng.
Six people are being trained to care for beehives that were discovered at Moja Gabedi, a UP community engagement project which was an unoffi-cial rubbish dump for about 100 years.Moja Gabedi was an un-sightly, empty lot in Festival Street, not far from the uni-versity’s Hatfield Campus. The university’s Commu-nity Engagement Unit  trans-formed the dumpsite into a shelter for the homeless, with lush gardens, vegetables, trees and flowing canals.“When we started clear-ing the site, we discovered bees deep underground in a corner of the plot. When the site was developed further, professional beekeepers were called in to relocate the bees into a hive,” says Gernia van Niekerk, Moja Gabedi’s Community Engagement Manager.While there was initially only one hive, three more have been added since June 2020. This presented an opportu-nity to train UP students and community members to care for the hives, and Mike Lang from Urban Bees offered to conduct a beekeeping course. Thanks to sponsors of protective gear and tools for beekeeping, the course was offered for free to two UP students, three commu-nity members and two urban farmers.They all attended an in-troductory class and were taught about bees, how a bee colony works, how to work with beekeeping equipment and safety practices. UP student Daddy Kgonothi says at first, he wasn’t really interested in bees.“When I learnt more, I understood that one should make the garden user-friend-ly for bees. If you know how to approach bees correctly, you’ll come to see that they are fascinating insects, he says.Community member Reckson Tshehla, who also attended the course, is keen to expand his knowledge about bees."It was the first time I saw a queen bee. I never thought I would get the opportunity to learn about bees."Moja Gabedi changed me. I experienced many things for the first time. Everything is so well organised," he says. Follow up training and practical classes will be con-ducted on colony manage-ment, managing diseases, honey production and pro-cessing, handling beeswax and pollen trapping. Those who complete the training will work with the site’s bees and get practical experience with Urban Bees.Bees make life sweeter at Moja Gabedi
