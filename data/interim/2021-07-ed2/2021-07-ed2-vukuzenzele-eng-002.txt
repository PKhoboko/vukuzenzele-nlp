HEALTH Vuk’uzenzele7July 2021 Edition 2 GENERALPrevent identity theft  Kgaogelo LetsebeShenki Mabitsela  (28) is all too aware of identity theft and the crimes relating to it, as he has been a victim of it.
Mabitsela, from Modimolle in Limpopo, applied for a loan at a bank in November 2020, but was told he was over-indebted and didn’t qualify. “I went to apply for a short-term loan as I needed to make ends meet after being retrenched in June 2020. To my surprise, I was told I did not qualify. “I initially thought it was because of my unstable income, but it wasn’t. I knew I only had one clothing account and no other debt, so I asked for a printout of my profile,” he says. Mabitsela saw that two cellphone contracts, a R65 000  bank loan and numerous re tail shop accounts had been opened in his name. The debt was close to R100 000. “Just before the national level 5 lockdown, I lost my ID book. I thought it was somewhere in the house and wasn’t too worried because I had my smart card ID,” he says. After realising that someone was creating debt in his name, Mabitsela opened a case of stolen identity at the South African Police Service (SAPS). He had to write an affidavit stating that he lost his identity book and take it to credi tors with his case number to avoid being blacklisted. Mabitsela’s experience is not unique. According to the South African Fraud Prevention Service’s (SAFPS) 2020 fraud report, last year fraud increased by 161% in the Eastern Cape and 120% in Gauteng.Manie van Schalkwyk, the Executive Director of the SAFPS, says: “The most worrying is that impersonation fraud – otherwise known as identity fraud – has increased by an alarming 337%.” Van Schalkwyk says people must report a lost or stolen ID book or passport immediately. “Reporting the loss or theft to the SAFPS and the SAPS ensures that we are able to enter the details on our database and inform our members. They can then take additional care when confirming an identity.” 

If your ID book or passport is lost or stolen, call SAFPS at 011 867 2234 or email protection@safps.org.za. You should also call the SAPS at 08600 10111 or visit your nearest police station. GENERALAllison CooperA University of Pre toria (UP) com munity engage ment project is training students and community members to become beekeepers in Hatfield, Gauteng.
Six people are being trained to care for beehives that were discovered at Moja Gabedi, a UP community engagement project which was an unoffi-cial rubbish dump for about 100 years.Moja Gabedi was an un-sightly, empty lot in Festival Street, not far from the uni-versity’s Hatfield Campus. The university’s Communi-ty Engagement Unit  trans-formed the dumpsite into a shelter for the homeless, with lush gardens, vegetables, trees and flowing canals.“When we started clearing the site, we discovered bees deep underground in a cor-ner of the plot. When the site was developed further, professional beekeepers were called in to relocate the bees into a hive,” says Gernia van Niekerk, Moja Gabedi’s Community Engagement Manager.While there was initially only one hive, three more have been added since June 2020. This presented an opportu-nity to train UP students and community members to care for the hives, and Mike Lang from Urban Bees offered to conduct a beekeeping course. Thanks to sponsors of protective gear and tools for beekeeping, the course was offered for free to two UP students, three community members and two urban farmers.They all attended an in-troductory class and were taught about bees, how a bee colony works, how to work with beekeeping equipment and safety practices. UP student Daddy Kgon-othi says at first, he wasn’t really interested in bees.“When I learnt more, I understood that one should make the garden user-friend-ly for bees. If you know how to approach bees correctly, you’ll come to see that they are fascinating insects, he says.Community member Reckson Tshehla, who also attended the course, is keen to expand his knowledge about bees."It was the first time I saw a queen bee. I never thought I would get the opportunity to learn about bees."Moja Gabedi changed me. I experienced many things for the first time. Everything is so well organised," he says. Follow up training and practical classes will be con-ducted on colony manage-ment, managing diseases, honey production and pro-cessing, handling beeswax and pollen trapping. Those who complete the training will work with the site’s bees and get practical experience with Urban Bees.Bees make life sweeter at Moja Gabedi TO AVOID BECOMING  a victim of identity theft, it’s essential to immediately report a lost or stolen identity document or passport.
