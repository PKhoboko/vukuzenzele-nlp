Vuk’uzenzeleJune 2021 Edition 16 GENERALProtect children  from cyberbullying Basic Education focuses  on creating more jobs Kgaogelo Letsebe The cruelty and devastating effects of cyberbul lying on children have been laid bare in recent months.
In a recent case of cyber-bullying, Grade 10 learner Lufuno Mavhunga, from Mbilwi Secondary School in Limpopo, died by suicide after being beaten by another learner. Mavhunga over-dosed on prescription pills after the video of the beating was shared on social media. Cyber security experts from the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) say cyberbullying is ex-tremely harmful to children and can lead to depression, sadness, anger, frustration, anxiety and fear.“It can also lead to low self-esteem, delinquency, school violence, family prob-lems and suicidal thoughts,” explains CSIR senior re-searcher Sipho Ngobeni. Cyberbullying occurs when someone uses electronic com-munication to intentionally harass, threaten, embarrass, intimidate, stalk, humiliate or make fun of another person.Ngobeni says research shows that 41% of children develop social anxiety after experiencing cyberbullying, 37% develop depression, 26% have suicidal thoughts and 25% engage in self-harm.“These findings show that cyberbullying is a serious issue... Getting everyone involved – youth, parents, educators, law enforcement and social media companies – is the key to dealing with this problem,” he adds. Most cyberbullying, 42%, occurs on Instagram, 31% on Facebook, 31% on Snapchat, 12% on WhatsApp, 10% on YouTube and 9% on Twitter.CSIR expert Rofhiwa Net-shiya says there is a need for public education about all forms of cyberbullying. “We need to educate chil-dren that cyberbullying can lead to serious consequenc-es,” she says.To tackle cyberbullying, the CSIR team is working on a platform that detects bullying in chatrooms.“The platform will automat-ically detect cyberbullying on chat groups and block users who continue to send hate speech. It will give the user three warning messages and, if they persist, it will block them,” says Netshiya. She advises parents to install basic internet mon-itoring software on their children's devices to monitor their activities. “There are low-cost prod-ucts that can invisibly moni-tor the activities of your kids and privately email you the results as often as you like. These are very important to track internet sites visit-ed, downloads, chatroom conversations and instant messaging.”The CSIR offers the follow-ing tips for parents who sus-pect their children are victims of cyberbullying:
• Ensure the child feels safe, show unconditional sup-port.• Work with your child to arrive at a course of action that you both agree on.• Discuss the cyberbullying matter with the relevant school.• Contact parents of the ag-gressor to investigate the matter and remove offend-ing material.• Report the issue to police in the case of physical threats or extortion, stalk-ing, blackmail and the sex-ual exploitation of minors.• Educate your child about appropriate online behav-iour.• Reinforce positive morals and values.
 vMore Matshediso The Department of Basic Education says discussions are underway to review and repackage the Presidential Youth Employ ment Initiative (PYEI), with a proposed second phase to start later this year.
An announcement will be made by the department once the details have been finalised. The PYEI, implemented as the Basic Education Employment Initiative (BEEI) across all provinces, came to an end recently.The initial duration of the programme, which started in December 2020, was four months. This was extended by a month, until the end of April 2021. Through the initiative, the basic education sector created employment opportunities for more than 320 000 education and general education assistants who were placed in schools across the country. During the first phase of the BEEI, more than 27 600 school governing body-funded posts at public schools and posts at government subsidised independent schools were saved thanks to the funding it provided.“These posts came under threat due to schools experiencing financial distress, as a result of parents not being able to pay school fees due to the economic devastation caused by the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19),” the department says.The BEEI used direct public investment to create employment opportunities and provide support to workers negatively impacted by COVID-19.“The initiative was funded to the tune of R7 billion... Of this, R4.47 billion was targeted towards providing employment opportunities for the youth.”Over 868 000 applications were received from youth when the initiative started. Of the more than 320 000 successful candidates, 67% were education assistants and 33% were general school assistants. Education assistants helped with classroom preparation before lessons, supported teachers during lessons and managed learners after lessons.General school assistants helped with learner screen-ing and sanitising in the morning and during school hours.  They also assisted with integrating information and communication technol-ogy in classrooms.
