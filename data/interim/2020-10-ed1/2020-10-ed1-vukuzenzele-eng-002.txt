They can also send a message to the Facebook page: Gender Commission of South Africa.CGE provides access to justiceDale HesVictims of gen der-based vio lence (GBV) who struggle to find the help and support they need are urged to contact the Commission for Gender Equality (CGE).
The commission can assist with child maintenance, sexual harassment, gender discrimination and GBV , and offers free legal advice and services to victims. The commission’s Mofihli Teleki says one of the CGE’s roles is to help victims open court cases. “The legal department accompanies complainants to magistrates courts to open domestic violence cases and assists with the completion of necessary forms. The commission also plays a monitoring role in cases, including rape and sexual offences, sexual harassment and femicide.” The commission can also help a victim to obtain a protection order and often works with the National Prosecuting Authority to ensure that the victim gets a fair trial. “In this case, the commission conducts a Watching Brief and performs its monitoring function over GBV cases and examines key issues, such as insensitive conduct by presiding officers, secondary victimisation of survivors and in sensitive cross examination processes,” Teleki explains. When victims struggle to gain access to justice in Domestic Violence Courts, the commission can act on their behalf, providing legal representation. It is also able to refer victims for psychological support.  An essential serviceThe commission has been functioning throughout lockdown as an essential service.“Even though some court cases have been re-scheduled as a result of the lock down, urgent matters that pertain to domestic violence and GBV continue to receive attention through the justice system,” says Teleki. The commission ensures that the rights of the public are protected. South Africa is an open democracy, committed to fundamental human rights, including the right to equality and the inherent dignity of the person, as per the provisions of the Constitution.”GBV victim’s life saved by NGOSilusapho NyandaA victim of long-term gender-based violence (GBV) – who was beaten, threatened with murder and shot – says if it were not for Masimanyane Women’s Rights International, she would be dead.Lindelwa Ntanta (59), an East London resident, went through 18 years of abuse at the hands of her ex-husband, who she finally managed to divorce in 2018. She says his abuse led to one of her three children committing suicide. It start-ed with psychological and verbal abuse but quickly es-calated to physical assault. She says: “I got a protec-tion order against him and he was told not to come to my house. Within a few days, he broke the order and I had him arrested. After he was released, he came back with a gun and shot me in the legs, saying that he was going to kill me.”Over the years, despite not living with them anymore, he continued to harass the family, often targeting the spaza shop Ntanta ran by destroying her stock.Ntanta says Masimanyane Women’s Rights International, an NGO funded by the Department of Social Development, has provided tremendous support over the years. The Masimanyane team helped Ntanta obtain several protection orders over the years, assisted her with counselling and in get-ting her granddaughter’s school fees reduced.“I am alive because they have protected me from my abuser. Even now, they are assisting me with legal matters as my ex-husband is trying to sell the house we live in,” says Ntanta.Masimanyane is an anti-GBV organisation that has been in existence since 1996. It has offices in Mdantsane and East Lon-don Magistrate’s Courts, as well as staff based at the Fleet Street, Buffalo Flats and Duncan Village police stations. Community project man-ager for Masimanyane, Buyiswa Mhambi, says the organisation offers support services to victims of abuse, including counselling, shel-ter, abuse awareness and computer and craft skills. “The reason we have offic-es at police stations is so that we can help GBV victims the moment they go to report a case,” says Mhambi.
