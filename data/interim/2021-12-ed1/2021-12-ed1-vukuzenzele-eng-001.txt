Silusapho Nyanda Curbing corrup tion in the public service remains a government priority and the National Anti-Corruption Hotline makes it easy for members of the public to report suspected acts of corruption.
The hotline was launched by the Public Service Com-mission (PSC) in 2004 and since then, more than 100 000 calls reporting alle-gations of corruption and maladministration have been received. These calls by whistle-blowers have resulted in 24 035 cases of corruption, fraud and other crimes being investigated, says Public Service Commis-sioner Michael Seloane, who oversees all the work done by the commission.
Between 2020 and 2021, 337 cases were reported via the hotline. Thirty-five of these involve appointment and procurement irregularities that are being investigated by the PSC. The remaining cases were referred to other government departments or law enforcement agencies for investigation. The Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) housing, tender and social grant irregularities are among the most common allegations made.“During the lockdown we received a lot of tip-offs through email. We also have an automatic message recor-ding system for those who wish to call our hotline after hours,” Seloane says.He adds that since the lowering of lockdown levels, there has been a steady increase in the reporting of social grant-related fraud, especially Social Relief of Distress grants.To strengthen efforts to curb corruption, the State has capacitated law enforce-ment agencies with skilled personnel, and established the Fusion Centre. The centre is a grouping of law enforcement agencies Image: unsplashed.comIF YOU SUSPECT  corruption, fraud, theft or other wrongdoing in the public service, you are urged to report it.

Lodging GEPF complaints  made easyMembers, pen sioners and beneficiaries of the Government Employees Pension Fund (GEPF) now have recourse when unhappy with the service they receive.
To ensure the GEPF members and their families are treated fairly, the board recently established an office to handle disputes. The Government Employees Pension Ombud (GEPO) is an internal but independent office of the GEPF. The GEPF is among the largest pension funds in the world, with over 1.2 million active members and more than 450 000 pensioners and beneficiaries. The fund was founded and is regulated in terms of the Government Employees Pension Law.Advocate Makhado Rama-bulana has been appointed as the Ombud. He says the office was established to assist people who are unhappy with the services of the GEPF. It will be especially bene-ficial to people who cannot afford legal recourse. Before people take their disputes to the Office of the Public Pro-tector or to the courts, they can seek mediation from the Ombud.The Ombud will inter-vene in matters that lead to unreasonable delays in the processing of payments due to claimants. It may only mediate in complaints that have arisen within the past three years.Other issues within the GEPO’s scope include:
• The failure of officials to perform their duties in terms of the Fund’s law and rules; 
• Breaking a commitment without a justifiable rea-son; and• Incorrect or misleading in-formation provided by the GEPF employees.Before lodging a complaint with the GEPO, a person must send a written com-plaint to either the GEPF, the Government Pensions Administration Agency (GPAA) or their employer, and give them a chance to settle the matter.“You must allow them 30 days to correct the issues that you identified. If, after 30 days, your issues remain unresolved, you can submit a complaint to the Ombud,” explains Ramabulana.The Ombud cannot accept a case if there is already an official investigation under-way elsewhere. “Within two weeks from the date that the complaint is received, the GEPO will consider [the case] and inform the complainant whether it can investigate and decide on the matter.” If the Ombud refuses to investigate a complaint, the complainant can write to the GEPO office within 21 days providing reasons why he or she believes the complaint falls within the GEPO’s mandate.

  What happens after a tip-off is made?Seloane says when a case is reported via the hotline, early resolution officers check that all the relevant information is provided. This includes the details of who did what, when the alleged act took place, and why.He says if wrongdoing is found – be it procure-ment and appointment irregularities, bribery, RDP housing related corrup-tion, social grant fraud, illegal migration, assault, theft or fraud – the PSC either recommends reme-dial action to the relevant department or refers the case to the Hawks, SAPS or Anti-Corruption Task Team for further investiga-tion.Cases the PSC refers to departments for investiga-tion, include:
• Public servants doing extra work for money without consent of the departments• Undeclared conflicts of interests, and • Unethical behaviour. Seloane says the PSC gives government departments 60 days to investigate and close a case. He says the depart-ment then informs the PSC of its findings. “If we are happy with the steps taken by the department, we will close the case, but if we are not satisfied, we revert back to them.”Anonymity  guaranteedWhen a whistle-blower does not want his/her identity revealed, the PSC hotline officer takes down only their contact details. This is important because if extra information is needed, the PSC must be able to contact them.Whistle-blowers who report cases to the PSC hotline are assured protec-tion if they want to remain anonymous, says Seloane. He explains that early resolution officers have been trained to ensure that a whistle-blower’s identity remains protected.Seloane says South Africans must report corruption because it steals from the poor and stops development, which prevents the country from moving forward.
