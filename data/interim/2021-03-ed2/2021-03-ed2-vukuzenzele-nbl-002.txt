Vuk’uzenzeleUNtaka 2021 umGadangiso 2 HEALTH 5 ZAMAPHILOKugidingwa Ilanga Loburhonodiswa (iDown Syndrome) EphasinilokeKgaogelo LetsebeIHlangano eQalelela zoBurhonodiswa  emaZweni ngamaZwe ifakazele ilanga lomhla wama-21 kuNtaka nje ngeLanga loBurhonodi swa (iDown Syndrome) eku zakugidingwa ngalo labo abalwela ukuqalelelwa  nokutjhejwa kwabatha ndiweko babo abanoku gula koburhonodiswa.
I-Down Syndrome  (i-DS) ikugula kwamakhromo zowumi azihlukanisako umuntu nakasikimako (na kabasidisi).  UDorhodere weMpumalanga uDorh.
Midah Maluleka uthi, “Kunekhromozowuni 21 engezelelweko (iTrisomy 21) eriyadisa ukukhula komzi mba nengqondo yomuntu.  Akunanobangela owaziwa kuhle wobukhona bekhro -mozowumi engezelelweko le. Kunobufakazi bokuthi akukaphathelani nobukhulu bomuntu (ubukhulu besi khathi sokubelethwa noku phila), akukaphathelani no kuthi umuntu uphila njani nokuthi unothe kangangani, nokuthi umhlobobani no kuthi ukholelwa kiyiphi ikolo. Godu akusikugula umuntu akuthola ngefuzo.” UDorh. Maluleka ungeze lela ngokuthi i-DS ikugula okuvamise khulu emasaneni asandukubelethwa. “Ema zweni athuthukileko, isana linye emasaneni ayikulu ngwana liba nalokhuku gula, ukube kanti emazweni asathuthukako, njengaleli lekhethu, lisana linye kama650 elibelethwa line-DS.
Ubuncani bakhona ama-80% wabantwana abane-DS abo nina bababeletha bangaphasi kweminyaka yobudala ema-35, ngitjho nanyana kuthiwa batjho abomma ababeletha sebangaphezulu kwama-35 weminyaka ngibo abase ngozini ekulu yokuthola abantwana abane-DS nje.” Uthi njengoba ukugulokhu kuthoma ukubonakala umuntu nakathoma uku tjhisa nje, kuneentjengiso umuntu ekufuze aziqale.
“Ekusikimeni kwakamma, kuphakanyiswa bona umma loyo akhanyiswe ngesipo polo esikhanyisa ngapha kathi nakaneemveke ezili-12 ukuya kezili-13. Lokhu ku kghona ukulinganisa kuhle ukuthi amanzana angemva kwendlebe yomntwana  (abizwa ngenuchal translu cency) amabhombo kanga ngani. Amanzana lawa ava mise ukuba mabhombo khudlwana ebantwaneni abane-DS.
Enye indlela yokuhlola ngaphambi kokubeletha kwakamma kubizwa bona yi-amniocentesis . Lokhu-ke kwenziwa ngokuthumela  amanzana wengubo  yomntwana ayokuhlolwa amakhromozowumi. Le ndlela yokuhlola-ke ivami sile ukuveza imiphumela pheze enembako, enesiqini seko esima-98%.”  UDorh. Maluleka uqini sekise wathi, abentwana abane-DS baphila ipilo epheleleko,ehle bebaphile isikhathi eside.  Nanyana kungelapheki nje lokhukugula, kodwana abantu abaphethwe yi-DS bayazuza ngokuba nama khaya anethando, nango kuthola itjhejo leenhlahla elifaneleko, nangokuthola isizo kusese nesikhathi, nangokuvulelwa ithuba lokufunda nelokufundela umsebenzi.  Ngenca yetjhejo leenhlahla zokwelapha elithuthukileko, ubunengi babantu ababelethwe ne-DS esikhathini sanamhlanje se baphila bebafike pheze ema55 weminyaka yobudala.
Abantu abane-DS banemi zwa neendingo ezifanako nezabo boke abanye abantu, ngalokho-ke bafanele ba tholelwe amathuba netjhejo elifanako,” kuhlathulula uDorh. Maluleka.  Utitjhere weTlhagwini Tji ngalanga, u-Tshepo Kekana uthi, “Ayisibo boke abafundi beendingo ezikhethekileko ekufanele baye eenkolweni zokwelatjhwa neenkolweni ezikhethekileko. Bakhona abambadlwana abakghona ukufunda eenkolweni ezi jayelekileko. Ngokuhlala bafunda, basekelwa beba bekezelelwe, abafundi laba bangaphumelela ngokusezi ngeni eliphezulu.” vLocal doctor opens free clinic for Chatsworth communityA new clinic opened by a Durban-based doctor is assist ing the community in the fight against the Corona virus Disease (COVID-19) and it is doing it for free.
