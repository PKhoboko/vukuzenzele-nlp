Vuk’uzenzeleNdasa 2021 Ushicilelo 2 HEALTH 5 EZEMPILOUkugubha Usuku Lomhlaba LweDown Syndrome  Kgaogelo LetsebeINhlangano Yomhlaba ye-Down Syndrome  iqinisekise ukuthi  ngoNdasa zingama-21  nguSuku Lomhlaba LweDown Syndrome  ukuze kubungazwe labo abalwe la ukubandakanyeka kwa bathandiweyo babo abaphi la nalesi sifo.
I-Down Syndrome  (i-DS) iyingxenye yokuphazamiseka kumachromosome  okuqubuka ngesikhathi ukhulelwa.
UDkt Midah Maluleka ose benza njengodokotela eMpu malanga uthi, "kuba khona ukwengezeka kwichromo some  lama-21 ( iTrisomy 21) nokuyaye kubambezele ukukhula komzimba kanye nengqondo. Asikho isisusa ngqo esidala lechromosome  eyeqile. Sekuqinisekisiwe ukuthi lokhu akuhlangene neminyaka yobudala, isimo senhlalo nomnotho, ibala noma inkolo. Akusilo futhi ufuzo."UMaluleka uyengeza ngokuthi i-DS ingukufa okuhambisana namachromosome  okujwayelekile ebantwaneni abasanda ku zalwa. "Oyedwa ebantwaneni abayi-1000 abazalwayo ema zweni athuthukile omhlaba  noyedwa kubantwana aba ngama-650 abazalwayo ema zweni asathuthuka, njenge zwe lakithi, bayathinteka.
Babalelwa kumaphesenti angama-80 abantwana abane sifo se-DS abazalwa ngabazali abaneminyaka engama-35, ngaphandle kwalokho abesi fazane abathola abantwana beneminyaka engama-35 basengcupheni yokuthi abantwana babo babe ne-DS."Uthi ngoba lokhu kufa kungatholakala kusukela ukhulelwa, kanti futhi ku khona izinkomba ezibonaka layo nokumele uzibheke.
"Ngasekuqaleni kwezigaba zokukhulelwa, ukuhlolwa komntwana esesiswini ema vikini ayi-12 kuya kwayi-13 kubalulekile. Lokhu kukala ka hle ukushuba koketshezi nge muva kwentamo yomntwa na, nokubizwa phecelezi ngenuchal translucency . Kanti lokhu kuvame ukuba ku khulu kakhulu ebantwaneni abane-DS.
Enye futhi indlela yoku hlola ngaphambi kokubeletha  ukwenza uhlolo olubizwa ngeamniocentesis . Lapha kusuke kuqoqwa ingxenye encane yoketshezi iamni otic fluid  bese luthunyelwa ukuyocutshungulwa amachromosome . Lokhu kucwa ninga yindlela yokuhlonza esebenza kahle ngokubalelwa kumaphesenti angama-98."UMaluleka uthi abantwana abanesifo se-DS bayakwazi ukuphila ngokupheleleyo, ngokunempilo kanye noku phila isikhathi eside.  Noma lingekho ikhambi lokuyilapha, abantu abane-DS bayazuza kakhulu emakhaya anothando, ukunakekelwa ngokwelashwa okufanele, ukungenelela ngokuphuthu ma, emfundweni kanye nasemisebenzini yezandla. Ngenxa yokunakekelwa okuthe thuthu, abantu aba ningi abazalwe neDown syndrome  namhlanje bali ndeleke ukuphila  iminya ka elinganiselwa kuma-55.
Abantu abane-DS banemizwa kanye nezidingo ezifanayo njengabanye abantu futhi badinga amathuba kanye nokunakekelwa okufanayo," kusho uMaluleka.
Uthisha osebenzela eNya katho Ntshonalanga uTshepo  Kekana uthi, "Akusibona  bonke abafundi abaphila  nokukhubazeka abadinga  ukuyiswa ezikoleni zaba ntwana abaphila nokukhu bazeka kanye nezikole ezikhethekileyo. Kukhona ingcosana yalabo abaphila nokukhubazeka ekwaziyo ukwenza kahle kulezo zikole ezijwayelekile.  Ngokuqhube ka nokufunda, ukwesekelwa kanye nesineke, abafundi bengaqhakaza.”  vLocal doctor opens free clinic for Chatsworth communityA new clinic opened by a Durban-based doctor is assist ing the community in the fight against the Corona virus Disease (COVID-19) and it is doing it for free.
