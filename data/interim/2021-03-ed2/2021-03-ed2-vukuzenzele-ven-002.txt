 The clinic, operating from the Havenside Community Hall in Chatsworth, was es tablished by Dr Diveshni Govender (39) in a bid to cope with the second wave of COVID-19 infections. Hun dreds of patients have been treated at the clinic since it opened its doors in January.
“The number of COVID-19 patients we were seeing in creased to the point where I had to treat some patients in their cars, in the shopping complex where my practice is located,” she says.
Dr Govender contacted community activists to assist with gettin g her access to use the Havenside Community Hall as a makeshift clinic.
Govender says that the clinic is run on donations from several non-governmental organisations, businesses and members of the com munity.
The 30-bed clinic has helped patients like Jeeveshni Abra ham (47) and her family.
Abraham, her husband and two children were admitted to the clinic after her symp toms started to worsen.
“At the clinic, we received quality care and medication.
We also had access to oxygen to help with breathing a lit tle easier when we were in distress. The clinic also ad mitted my brother, his wife and children when they con -tracted the virus, “she says.
When Abrahams and her family were discharged from the clinic they received medi cine packages to take home.
Dr Govender says that the free medicine they dispense from the clinic is made pos sible through donations from members of the community.
According to her, the clinic mainly treats patients who are above 45 years of age, with about 10% of patients under the age of 12. She says that the clinic has also part nered with a private ambu lance company to transport patients who need elevated care to a h ospital, at no cost.
Dr Govender says: “The partnership has saved several lives as patients who are in urgent need of transport to a hospital no longer have to wait a long time for an am bulance.”Dr Govender is assisted by two nurses and has also employed a cleaner to assist at the clinic.  vCOMMUNITY-FUNDED  clinic  gives patients with COVID-19 a fighting chance.
