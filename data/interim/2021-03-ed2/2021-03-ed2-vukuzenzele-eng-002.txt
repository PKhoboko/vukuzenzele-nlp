Vuk’uzenzeleMarch 2021 Edition 2 HEALTH5 HEALTHLocal doctor opens free clinic  for Chatsworth communityA new clinic opened by a Durban-based doctor is assisting the community in the fight against the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) and it is doing it for free.
 The clinic, operating from the Havenside Community Hall in Chatsworth, was established by Dr Diveshni Govender (39) in a bid to cope with the second wave of COVID-19 infections. Hun-dreds of patients have been treated at the clinic since it opened its doors in January.“The number of COVID-19 patients we were seeing in-creased to the point where I had to treat some patients in their cars, in the shopping complex where my practice is located,” she says.Dr Govender contacted community activists to assist with getting her access to use the Havenside Community Hall as a makeshift clinic. Govender says that the clinic is run on donations from several non-governmental organisations, businesses and members of the community.The 30-bed clinic has helped patients like Jeeveshni Abraham (47) and her family. Abraham, her husband and two children were admitted to the clinic after her symptoms started to worsen. “At the clinic, we received quality care and medication. We also had access to oxygen to help with breathing a little easier when we were in distress. The clinic also admitted my brother, his wife and children when they contracted the virus, “she says.When Abrahams and her family were discharged from the clinic they received medicine packages to take home.Dr Govender says that the free medicine they dispense from the clinic is made possible through donations from members of the community.According to her, the clinic mainly treats patients who are above 45 years of age, with about 10% of patients under the age of 12. She says that the clinic has also partnered with a private ambu lance company to transport patients who need elevated care to a hospital, at no cost.Dr Govender says: “The partnership has saved several lives as patients who are in urgent need of transport to a hospital no longer have to wait a long time for an am-bulance.”Dr Govender is assisted by two nurses and has also employed a cleaner to assist at the clinic.

Kgaogelo LetsebeDown Syndrome  International has confirmed March 21 as World Down Syndrome Day, to celebrate those fighting for the inclusion of their loved ones who are living with the illness.
Down Syndrome (DS) is a chromosomal disorder arising at the time of conception. Mpumalanga-based medical practitioner Dr Midah Maluleka says: "There is an extra number 21 chromosome (Trisomy 21) which causes delays in physical and intellectual development. There’s no definite cause for this extra chromosome.  It has been proven to have no relation to age, socio-eco-nomic status, race or religion. It is also not hereditary."Maluleka adds that DS is the most common chromosomal disorder in new-borns. "One in 1 000 babies born in first world countries with one in 650 babies born in developing countries , like ours, are affected. At least 80% of children affected by DS are born from mothers under the age of 35, despite wom-en over the age of 35 being deemed to be at higher risk of having a child with DS."She says because the dis-order can be picked up at conception, there are some tell-tale signs to look out for. "In the early stages of pregnancy, a  1213 week ultrasound scan is advised.This accurately measures the thickness of fluid behind the baby's neck, called the nuchal translucency. This is often larger in babies with DS. Another prenatal test is an amniocentesis. This is when small amounts of amniotic fluid is collected and sent for chromosome analysis. This test is about 98% accu-rate for diagnosis."Maluleka says that chil-dren with DS are able to live full, healthy and long lives.  “Although there’s no cure, people with DS benefit from loving homes, appropriate medical care, early inter-vention, educational and vocational services. Due to advanced medical care, most people born with DS today have a life expectancy of approximately 55 years. People with DS have the same emotions and needs as any other person and deserve the same oppor-tunities and care," says Maluleka.North West-based teacher Tshepo Kekana says, "Not all special needs students need to go to remedial and special schools. There are a few who cope in mainstream schools.  With continued learning, support and patience, the students can flourish.”  v
