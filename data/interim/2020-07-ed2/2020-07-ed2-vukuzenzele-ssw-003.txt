9Vuk’uzenzeleKwakha likusasa lelinconoImifundzate yeMISA ikhangiswa kuwww.misa.gov.za kusukela ngeNyoni, kuFacebook @MISA, kuTwitter @MISA_CoGTA nakuInstagram  @MISA_CoGTA.Umuntfu lotitfobile lobekangasilutfo lobuya esigodzini sakwaNongoma, KwaZulu-Natal, Silondiwe Magwaza loneminyaka le-23 wancoba tihibe letinengi kute aphumelelise liphupho lakhe lekuba ngumphatsi wetekwakha.  Kukhula abona sakhiwo-nchanti lesingasisihle  kwakhutsata Magwaza kutsi abuke tindlela letinsha tekuphakamisa ummango wakhe. Nyalo nguye wekucala lomsikati emndenini wakhe kutfola ticu. Magwaza watfola ticu takhe Eyunivesithi YaseWitwate-rsrand ngemnyaka we-2019, watfola ticu tekucala tetifu-ndvo tetekwakha. “IkwaNongoma inesakhiwonchanti lesizingeni le liphansi futsi kuphakelwa kwaso kubonakala kuhamba ngesivinini lesincane kakhulu. Kubuka tonkhe tinsayeya letibukene nelidolobhatsi, kwangigcugcutela kutsi ngente lokutsite lokumayelana netekwakha kute ngibe ngilomunye webantfu laba-tawugucula lesimo lesikhona nyalo,” usho njalo.
Kutfola ticu takhe beku-ngasiyo intfo lemalula. Ma-gwaza utsi bekulikhuni kubeka wonkhe umcondvo wakhe etifundvweni ngenca yekuhlala akhatsatekile ngemali. Ngaleso sikhatsi, i-Ejensi Yekusekela Sakhiwonchanti Samasipala (MISA) yangenelela yamsita.
“Bengivame kukhatsateka kakhulu mayelana nemali njengoba ngiphuma emnde-nini lobewuncishwe ematfuba. Kwate kwaba ngumnyaka we-2018, lapho ngatfola khona umfundzate lokhishwa yi-MISA.

TAKAMUVA NGECOVID-19Don’t share fake news!You can report fake news by emailing fake-newsalert@dtps.gov.za, sending a WhatsApp to 067 966 4015 or on the website www.real411.org.Allison CooperNelisiwe Dlamini (30), a researcher at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), says it’s important to verify stories from social media, especially those about the coronavirus (COV ID-19),  before sharing them. “Some young people are becoming ringleaders of the spread of false information. This has the potential to cre-ate panic,” she says.Since the outbreak of COV-ID-19, the CSIR has created a dashboard to assist govern-ment and health institutions to track the spread of misinformation, in order to avoid unnecessary public panic. The dash-board categorises infor-mation as misinformation (misleading content), disinformation  (information that is untrue and mal-information (hate speech).Dlamini is part of the team that does research and also helps catego-rise information in the dashboard.A data dashboard is an in-formation management tool or website that tracks, analy-ses and displays information to monitor the performance of a business or department. According to Dlamini, so-cial media platforms become a great danger when used to share false information.“Whether it’s with the inten-tion to harm or not, it creates social conflict, distracts peo-ple from the real issues and undermines government’s, public authorities’ and other organisations’ efforts to curb the spread of COVID-19 and maintain social order.”She says there are numer-ous ways to identify fake news, including reading the whole story and not just the heading, being critical of everything you read and examining the source of the story.“Reporting fake news is necessary, as it will help to take down fake news stories from multiple platforms,” says Dlamini.  A journey to research Dlamini joined the CSIR in 2014, when she was awarded a studentship to pursue her MSc Computer Science degree. “It was a foot in the door for me and has since afforded me great opportunities,” she says. She was also awarded a grant from the Young Re-searcher’s Establishment Fund, which she sites as a wonderful opportunity in her career.Born in Pinetown, Kwa-Zulu-Natal, Dlamini says women hoping to follow in her footsteps need to be inter-ested in and have a passion for research. To become a researcher, learners need to take maths and science in high school. “After school I studied com-puter science and informa-tion systems and technology, which laid a strong founda-tion for me,” says Dlamini, who also holds a BcomHon Information Systems and Technology degree. She didn’t always know she wanted to be a researcher. “When I joined the CSIR, I was so amazed by the mul-ti-disciplinary research that is done to make a difference in our country,” she says.This Women’s Day, Dlamini says if there was ever a time for women to be bold and do everything they have ever wished to do, it is now. “We need to support each other and unite and always remem-ber to celebrate each other. This alone will propel us.”Passionate researcher at the CSIR, Nelisiwe Dlamini, warns South Africans, especially the youth, not to share fake news because it creates panic especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.
