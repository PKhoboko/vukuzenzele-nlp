 9CORONAVIRUSUPDATECORONAVIRUSUPDATEJuly 2020 Edition 2Building a better lifeMISA bursaries are advertised on www.misa.gov.za from September, on Facebook @MISA, on Twitter @MISA_CoGTA and on Instagram @MISA_CoGTA.From humble begin nings in KwaNon goma village, Kwa Zulu-Natal, 23-year-old Silondiwe Magwaza has conquered many obstacles to reach her dream of becoming a construction manager.  Growing up surrounded by poor infrastructure motivat-ed Magwaza to explore new ways to uplift her communi-ty. She is now the first mem-ber of her family to obtain a degree.  Magwaza qualified at the University of the Witwa-tersrand in 2019, obtaining an undergraduate degree in construction studies.  “KwaNongoma has very poor infrastructure. Looking at all the challenges faced by my hometown, I was encouraged to do something relating to construction so that I can be one of the people to change the current state,” she says. Obtaining her qualification was no easy feat. Magwaza says she found it difficult to concentrate due to her constant worry about fund-ing. Then, the Municipal Infrastructure Support Agent (MISA) stepped in to assist."I used to stress a lot about funding as I come from a disadvantaged background. That was until 2018, when I received a bursary from MISA. This helped me to complete my degree with-out any more stress. I had everything paid for, all I had to do was focus on my stud-ies,” she says.Magwaza is one of hun-dreds of students who pass through MISA’s youth development programmes each year. The programmes provide funding and support and help students find job placements once qualified.  “I was really looking for-ward to our graduation cer-emony. It would have meant a lot considering that I was going to be the first graduate in my family. I am still hoping that we have our graduation ceremony, but this might not be possible given the corona-virus pandemic,” she says.The construction industry mainly consists of men. “At times, women are made to feel small because their ability to bring about change is doubted. Sometimes their voices are not heard.“I still chose construction management because I be-lieve that I have the power to change the industry and improve it where there is a need. I have seen women in this industry making it to top positions and having influence. I believe that I too can make it,” she says. Don’t share fake news!You can report fake news by emailing fake-newsalert@dtps.gov.za, sending a WhatsApp to 067 966 4015 or on the website www.real411.org.Allison CooperNelisiwe Dlamini (30), a researcher at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), says it’s important to verify stories from social media, especially those about the coronavirus (COVID-19),  before shar ing them. “Some young people are becoming ringleaders of the spread of false information. This has the potential to create panic,” she says.Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the CSIR has created a dashboard to as-sist government and health institutions to track the spread of misinforma-tion, in order to avoid unnecessary public panic. The dashboard categorises informa-tion as misinformation (misleading content), disinformation (information that is untrue and mal-in-formation  (hate speech).Dlamini is part of the team that does research and also helps  cate-gorise  infor-mation in the dashboard.A data dashboard is an in-formation management tool or website that tracks, analy-ses and displays information to monitor the performance of a business or department. According to Dlamini, so-cial media platforms become a great danger when used to share false information.“Whether it’s with the in-tention to harm or not, it cre-ates social conflict, distracts people from the real issues and undermines govern-ment’s, public authorities’ and other organisations’ efforts to curb the spread of COVID-19 and maintain social order.”She says there are numer-ous ways to identify fake news, including reading the whole story and not just the heading, being critical of everything you read and examining the source of the story.“Reporting fake news is necessary, as it will help to take down fake news stories from multiple platforms,” says Dlamini.  A journey to research Dlamini joined the CSIR in 2014, when she was awarded a studentship to pursue her MSc Computer Science degree. “It was a foot in the door for me and has since afforded me great opportunities,” she says. She was also awarded a grant from the Young Re-searcher’s Establishment Fund, which she sites as a wonderful opportunity in her career.Born in Pinetown, Kwa-Zulu-Natal, Dlamini says women hoping to follow in her footsteps need to be interested in and have a passion for research. To become a researcher, learners need to take maths and science in high school. “After school I studied com-puter science and informa-tion systems and technology, which laid a strong founda-tion for me,” says Dlamini, who also holds a BcomHon Information Systems and Technology degree. She didn’t always know she wanted to be a research-er. “When I joined the CSIR, I was so amazed by the mul-ti-disciplinary research that is done to make a difference in our country,” she says.This Women’s Day,  Dlamini says if there was ever a time for women to be bold and do everything they have ever wished to do, it is now. “We need to support each other and unite and always remember to celebrate each other. This alone will propel us.”Passionate researcher at the CSIR, Nelisiwe Dlamini, warns South Africans, especially the youth, not to share fake news because it creates panic especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. As the first graduate in her family, Silondiwe Magwaza has MISA to thank.
