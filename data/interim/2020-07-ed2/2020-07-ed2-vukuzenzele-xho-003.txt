9Vuk’uzenzeleUkwakha ubomi obungconoIibhasari ze-MISA zipapashwa apha: www.misa.gov.za uku-susela kweyoMsintsi, kwiFacebook  @MISA, kwiTwitter @MISA_CoGTA nakwiInstagram  @MISA_CoGTA.Nangona ekhule  engathathi ntweni kwilali yaKwa-Nongoma, kwiphondo laKwaZulu-Natal, uSilo-ndiwe Magwaza oneminya-ka engama-23 ubudala uhambe nzima kakhulu wade waphumeza iphupha lakhe lokuba ngumphathi kwezokwakha.  Ukukhula engqongwe ziziseko zezibonelelo ez ingekho mgangathweni kwakhuthaza uMagwaza ukuba aphononongeiindlela ezintsha zokunyusaumgangatho kwindawo ehlala kuyo. Ngoku ungo-wokuqala kusapho lwakhe ukuba nemfundo yesidanga okanye enomsila.  UMagwaza ufumene imfu ndo yesidanga yokuqala kwi zifundo zokwakha kwiYuni vesithi yase-Witwatersrand ngowama-2019.  “Indawo yaKwaNongoma ineziseko zezibonelelo ezingekho mgangathweni kanti nokulungiswa kwale meko kuhamba ngesantya solovane. Ndithe ndakuqwalasela yo-nke imingeni ejongene nayo idolophu yam, ndafumana inkuthazo yokuba ndifunde okunxulumene nokwakha ukuze ndibe ngomnye waba-ntu abaguqula imeko ekhoyo ngoku,” utsho. Ibinzima indlela eya empu melelweni kwizifundo zakhe. Bekunzima kuMagwaza ukuzikisa ingqondo kwizifundo zakhe ngenxa yokusoloko ekhathazwa yingxaki yenkxaso-mali. Kodwa i-Arhente kaMasipala yokuXhasa iziSeko ezinguNdoqo (i-MISA) iya yangenelela yanika uncedo.
“Ndandixhalaba kakhulu kukungabi nankxaso-mali njengoko ndiphuma kwikhaya elingathathi ntweni.  Oko kwaqhuba kwada kwa-ngowama-2018, ndaza ndafumana ibhasari kwi-MISA. Ndancedakala kangangokuba ndifumene imfundo yesida-nga sendingasenankxalabo kwaphela. Ndandihlawulelwa konke, inye kuphela into ebi-funeka, ikukuzikisa ingqondo kwizifundo zam,” utsho.
UMagwaza ngomnye wa-makhulu abafundi abafundi-swa ngeenkqubo ze-MISA zophuhliso lolutsha ngo-nyaka ngamnye. Ezi nkqubo zinikela ngemali nangenkxaso yokunceda abafundi ukuba bafumane amathuba emisebenzi bakuba bephumelele kwizifundo zabo.  “Ngenene bendililangazelela umsitho wothweso-zidanga. Oko bekubaluleke kakhulu kum njengoko bendiza kuba ngowokuqala ukuba ne-mfundo yesidanga kwikhaya lam. Ndisenethemba lokuba siza kuba nawo lo msitho wothweso-zidanga, kodwa kusenokungabi njalo ngenxa kabhubhane wehlabathi wentsholongwane ye-corona ,” utsho.
Kushishino lokwakha ku-xhaphake amadoda. “Maxa wambi, abantu abangabafazi benziwa bazive bengenabuchule kuba isa-khono sabo sokuzisa ingu quko sithandabuzeka. Ngamanye amaxesha amazwi abo awamanyelwa.
“Nangoku ndisakhetha ulawulo kwezokwakha kuba ndikholelwa ekubeni ndinawo amandla okuguqula eli candelo ndiliphucule apho kudingeka khona. Sendibone abantu ababhinqileyo kweli candela bephumelela bade bafumane izikhundla eziphezulu futhi benze no-tshintsho. Nam ndiyakho-lwa ukuba ndiza kulandela umzekelo wabo,” utsho.  Njengowokuqala kusapho lwakhe ukuba nemfundo yesidanga, uSilondiwe Magwaza ubulela i-MISA.
Don’t share fake news!You can report fake news by emailing fake-newsalert@dtps.gov.za, sending a WhatsApp to 067 966 4015 or on the website www.real411.org.Allison CooperNelisiwe Dlamini (30), a researcher at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), says it’s important to verify stories from social media, especially those about the coronavirus (COVID-19),  before shar ing them. “Some young people are becoming ringleaders of the spread of false information. This has the potential to create panic,” she says.Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the CSIR has created a dashboard to as-sist government and health institutions to track the spread of misinforma-tion, in order to avoid unnecessary public panic. The dashboard categorises informa-tion as misinformation (misleading content), disinformation (information that is untrue and mal-in-formation  (hate speech).Dlamini is part of the team that does research and also helps categorise infor-mation in the dashboard.A data dashboard is an in-formation management tool or website that tracks, analy-ses and displays information to monitor the performance of a business or department. According to Dlamini, so-cial media platforms become a great danger when used to share false information.“Whether it’s with the in-tention to harm or not, it cre-ates social conflict, distracts people from the real issues and undermines govern-ment’s, public authorities’ and other organisations’ efforts to curb the spread of COVID-19 and maintain social order.”She says there are numer-ous ways to identify fake news, including reading the whole story and not just the heading, being critical of everything you read and examining the source of the story.“Reporting fake news is necessary, as it will help to take down fake news stories from multiple platforms,” says Dlamini.  A journey to research Dlamini joined the CSIR in 2014, when she was awarded a studentship to pursue her MSc Computer Science degree. “It was a foot in the door for me and has since afforded me great opportunities,” she says. She was also awarded a grant from the Young Re-searcher’s Establishment Fund, which she sites as a wonderful opportunity in her career.Born in Pinetown, Kwa-Zulu-Natal, Dlamini says women hoping to follow in her footsteps need to be interested in and have a passion for research. To become a researcher, learners need to take maths and science in high school. “After school I studied com-puter science and informa-tion systems and technology, which laid a strong founda-tion for me,” says Dlamini, who also holds a BcomHon Information Systems and Technology degree. She didn’t always know she wanted to be a research-er. “When I joined the CSIR, I was so amazed by the mul-ti-disciplinary research that is done to make a difference in our country,” she says.This Women’s Day,  Dlamini says if there was ever a time for women to be bold and do everything they have ever wished to do, it is now. “We need to support each other and unite and always remember to celebrate each other. This alone will propel us.”Passionate researcher at the CSIR, Nelisiwe Dlamini, warns South Africans, especially the youth, not to share fake news because it creates panic especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.EZINTSHA NGECOVID-19EyeKhala 2020 Ushicilelo 2
