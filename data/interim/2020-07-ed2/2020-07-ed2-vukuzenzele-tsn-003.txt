Go tswa kgolong ya ga-gwe a dikaganyeditswe ke mafaratlhatlha a a loleya, go rotloeditse Magwaza go sekasekana le mekgwa e mešwa go tokafatsa baagi ba gaabo. Gajaana ke leloko lantlha go balelapa go iponela gerata.
Magwaza o ithutetse kwa yubesithing ya Witwatersrand ka 2019, a iponela ge-rata ya ntlha go dithuto tsa dikago.
“KwaNongoma e na le ma faratlhatlha a a bokoa mme le tirelo ya go baakanya seno e bonya tota. Fa ke lebelela di-kgwetlho tse di itemoge-lwang mo teropong ya ga-etsho, ke ne ka rotloetsega go dira sengwe se se amanang le tsa kago jalo go fetola maemo a gajaana,” a rialo. Go fitlhelela dithutego tse go ne go se bonolo. Magwaza a re o fitlhetse go le boima go tsepamisa maikutlo ka ntlha ya matshwenyego a a neng a le mo magetleng a gagwe ka matlole. Mme, Agente ya Tshegetso go Mafaratlhatlha a Dimmasepala (MISA) e ne ya mo rola boima jono.

Go aga botshelo jo bo botokaPhukwi 2020 Kgatiso 2Don’t share fake news!You can report fake news by emailing  fakenewsalert@dtps.gov.za, sending a WhatsApp to 067 966 4015 or on the website  www.real411.org.Allison CooperNelisiwe Dlamini (30), a researcher at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), says it’s important to verify stories from social media, especially those about the coronavirus (COVID-19),  before shar ing them. “Some young people are becoming ringleaders of the spread of false information. This has the potential to create panic,” she says.Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the CSIR has created a dashboard to as-sist government and health institutions to track the spread of misinforma-tion, in order to avoid unnecessary public panic. The dashboard categorises informa-tion as misinformation (misleading content), disinformation (information that is untrue and mal-in-formation  (hate speech).Dlamini is part of the team that does re-search and also helps categorise information in the dashboard.A data dash-board is an information man-agement tool or website that tracks, analyses and displays information to monitor the performance of a business or department. According to Dlamini, so-cial media platforms become a great danger when used to share false information.“Whether it’s with the in-tention to harm or not, it cre-ates social conflict, distracts people from the real issues and undermines govern-ment’s, public authorities’ and other organisations’ efforts to curb the spread of COVID-19 and maintain social order.”She says there are numer-ous ways to identify fake news, including reading the whole story and not just the heading, being critical of everything you read and examining the source of the story.“Reporting fake news is necessary, as it will help to take down fake news stories from multiple platforms,” says Dlamini.  A journey to research Dlamini joined the CSIR in 2014, when she was awarded a studentship to pursue her MSc Computer Science degree. “It was a foot in the door for me and has since afforded me great opportunities,” she says. She was also awarded a grant from the Young Re-searcher’s Establishment Fund, which she sites as a wonderful opportunity in her career.Born in Pinetown, Kwa-Zulu-Natal, Dlamini says women hoping to follow in her footsteps need to be interested in and have a passion for research. To become a researcher, learners need to take maths and science in high school. “After school I studied com-puter science and informa-tion systems and technology, which laid a strong founda-tion for me,” says Dlamini, who also holds a BcomHon Information Systems and Technology degree. She didn’t always know she wanted to be a research-er. “When I joined the CSIR, I was so amazed by the mul-ti-disciplinary research that is done to make a difference in our country,” she says.This Women’s Day,  Dlamini says if there was ever a time for women to be bold and do everything they have ever wished to do, it is now. “We need to support each other and unite and always remember to celebrate each other. This alone will propel us.” v
