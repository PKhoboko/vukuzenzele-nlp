9Vuk’uzenzeleSakha Ipilo Engcono  Imifundalize ye-MISA ikhangiswa kuwww.misa.gov.za ukusukela ngoKhukhula-mungu, kuFacebook @MISA_CoGTA kunye nakuInstagram @MISA_CoGTA.USilondiwe Magwaza, onama-23 weminyaka,  odabuka KwaNongoma, KwaZulu-Natala weqe iinqabo ezinengi wayokuphumele lisa ibhudango lakhe lokuba mphathi wegontraga.  USilondiwe wakhulelaendaweni enganawo  umthangalasisekelo; lokho-ke kwamkhuthaza ukuthi afune iindlela ezitja zokuphakamisa umphakathi wangekhabo. Namhlanje selalilunga lokuthoma lomndeni wakwabo elithole iziqu zeyunivesithi.  USilondiwe uthole iziqu zakhe eYunivesithi ye-Witwatersrand eemfundweni zamagontraga  ngomnyaka wee-2019.
“Mtlhago ngomthangala sisekelo KwaNongoma, be godu nokutholakala kwawo kukhamba buthaka khulu. Ngathi nangiqala zoke ii-ntjhijilo eziqalene nendawo yangekhethu, ngakhuthazeka ukuthi ngenze okuthileko okuphathelene nezokwakha (amagontraga) kobanyana ngizokuba ngomunye waba-ntu abatjhugulula ubujamo bezinto kilendawo,” utjho ahlathulula.
 Azange kube lula ukuthola iziqu zakhe zefundo. USilondiwe uthi kwakubudisi ukubeka ingqondwakhe epheleleko eencwadini zakhe ngoba wayesolo ahlubayezwa yindaba yemali yokumfundisa. Kwathi khonapho kwavela i-Ejensi ESekela UmThangalasisekelo KaMasipaladi (i-MI SA), yamsiza.  “Ngangihlala ngibalabala ngendaba yemali yokubha-dela iimfundo zami njengoba ngimumuntu obuya ekhaya elinganamali nje. Lokho-ke kwenzeka bekwaba mnyaka wee-2018, mhlazana ngithola umfundalize we-MISA.  Lokhu-ke kwangisiza nga-kghona ukuqeda iziqu zami ngaphandle kokubalabala ukuya phambili. Bangibhadelela koke, mina kwakufuze ngiqalane neemfundo zami nje kwaphela,”  yatjho ingezelela intombi yakwaMagwaza. USilondiwe ungomunye wamakhulukhulu wabafundi adlule emahlelweni we-MISA wokuthuthukisa ilutjha. Amahlelo la asekela ngemali abe asekele nabafundi ukuthola umsebenzi nabaqeda ukufunda. “Ngangilindele isikhathi sokwethweswa kwethu iziqu ngethemba elihle. Ukwethweswa kwami iziqu kwakuzokuba yinto ekulu ngoba ngangiyokuba ngewokuthoma ekhaya ukufunda ngithole iziqu. Nanje ngisathemba ukuthi useza  kuba khona umnyanya wethu woku -thweswa iziqu, kowana angeze kukghonakale ngenca yobu-lwele obehlileko bengogwana yecorona  engumabhubhisa,” utjho araga.
Ibubulo lamagontraga lande ngamadoda.  “Kesinye isikhathi abantu abasikazi benziwa ukuthi bazinyaze ngoba ikghono labo lokwenza itjhuguluko liyazazeka. Kesinye isikhathi amezwi wabo awalalelwa, “Nanyana kunjalo, nga khetha wona umsebenzi wamagontraga wokwakha ngoba ngikholwa ukuthi nginawo amandla wokuletha amatjhuguluko ebubulweni lamagontraga wokwakha bengenze nobungcono lapho bufuneka khona. Ngibone abantu abasikazi kilelibubulo bakhuphuka bayokufika eenkhundleni eziphezulu begodu babe namandla. Ngi-kholwa ukuthi nami ngingakghona,” utjho ngesibindi . USilondiwe uthokoza i-MISA ngesizo layo elimenze waba sifundiswa sokuthoma ngakwabo.
ZAMVANJE NGECOVID-19Don’t share fake news!You can report fake news by emailing  fakenewsalert@dtps.gov.za, sending a WhatsApp to 067 966 4015 or on the website  www.real411.org.Allison CooperNelisiwe Dlamini (30), a researcher at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), says it’s important to verify stories from social media, especially those about the coronavirus (COVID-19),  before shar ing them. “Some young people are becoming ringleaders of the spread of false information. This has the potential to create panic,” she says.Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the CSIR has created a dashboard to as-sist government and health institutions to track the spread of misinforma-tion, in order to avoid unnecessary public panic. The dashboard categorises informa-tion as misinformation (misleading content), disinformation (information that is untrue and mal-in-formation  (hate speech).Dlamini is part of the team that does re-search and also helps categorise information in the dashboard.A data dash-board is an information man-agement tool or website that tracks, analyses and displays information to monitor the performance of a business or department. According to Dlamini, so-cial media platforms become a great danger when used to share false information.“Whether it’s with the in-tention to harm or not, it cre-ates social conflict, distracts people from the real issues and undermines govern-ment’s, public authorities’ and other organisations’ efforts to curb the spread of COVID-19 and maintain social order.”She says there are numer-ous ways to identify fake news, including reading the whole story and not just the heading, being critical of everything you read and examining the source of the story.“Reporting fake news is necessary, as it will help to take down fake news stories from multiple platforms,” says Dlamini.  A journey to research Dlamini joined the CSIR in 2014, when she was awarded a studentship to pursue her MSc Computer Science degree. “It was a foot in the door for me and has since afforded me great opportunities,” she says. She was also awarded a grant from the Young Re-searcher’s Establishment Fund, which she sites as a wonderful opportunity in her career.Born in Pinetown, Kwa-Zulu-Natal, Dlamini says women hoping to follow in her footsteps need to be interested in and have a passion for research. To become a researcher, learners need to take maths and science in high school. “After school I studied com-puter science and informa-tion systems and technology, which laid a strong founda-tion for me,” says Dlamini, who also holds a BcomHon Information Systems and Technology degree. She didn’t always know she wanted to be a research-er. “When I joined the CSIR, I was so amazed by the mul-ti-disciplinary research that is done to make a difference in our country,” she says.This Women’s Day,  Dlamini says if there was ever a time for women to be bold and do everything they have ever wished to do, it is now. “We need to support each other and unite and always remember to celebrate each other. This alone will propel us.”
