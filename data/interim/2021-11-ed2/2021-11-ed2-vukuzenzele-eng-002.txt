HEALTHGENERALHEALTHHEALTHBeware of sex offendersSphelele NgubaneIf you are an employer who runs an early childhood development centre, you are among the people required by law to check if your current and potential employees are on the National Register for Sex Offenders (NRSO).
The NRSO falls under the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development and employers must approach it to check if prospective employees are listed.An employer also includes a parent looking to employ a house helper, a school governing body or a hospital. The NRSO was established by an Act of Parliament in 2007. It is a record of names of those found guilty of sexual offences against children and people with intellectual disabilities.Ntombizodwa Matjila, the NRSO Registrar, says the register contains names of both male and female offenders. These are people who have committed offences against children and those with intellectual disabilities, such as:
• Statutory rape; 
• Compelling or causing children to witness sexual offences; • Sexual acts; • Sexual exploitation; • Sexual grooming; • Exposure or display of child pornography to chil-dren or people with intel-lectual disabilities and us-ing children or people with intellectual disabilities for pornographic purposes.“If an employer finds out that the name of an employee appears on the register, the employer must move that employee to another post that will not bring him or her in contact with a child or an adult with an intellectual disability,” says Matjila.If the employer is unable to move the employee to another position, they are required to terminate the employment contract.Information contained in the NRSO includes: Offenders’ full names and surname, nickname and their profession or trade;  Offenders’ known physical address, and any contact details, including a postal address; Offenders’ identity number or passport number; The type of sexual offence.The register is not open to the public. It can only be consulted by employers to obtain clearance certificates for those whose names are being checked. It is a crime to disclose to anyone else the information contained in the register.

Vuk’uzenzele5November 2021 Edition 2What to do if you’ve been sexually assaultedCathy GrosvenorIf you have been sex ually assaulted, these are the steps that you can follow to recieve help.
Seek medical help as soon as possible – At a healthcare facility, any injuries will be treated and evidence will be collected, which will help if your case goes to court. Medication will be provided to prevent HIV , other sexually transmitted infections and unwanted pregnancy. The easiest way to get medical help is to go to the closest hospital's emergency department, clinic, or police station. The SAPS are expected to provide transport to an appropriate healthcare facility.Things to avoid – Do not wash yourself before seeking help, because this will destroy vital evidence. If you must change your clothing, take the clothes you were wearing at the time of the attack with you.If you experienced forced oral sex or kissing, do not smoke, eat, drink or brush your teeth until you’ve been examined.Things to do –Take along sheets or other items that may have evidence on them. Place the unwashed items in a paper bag or roll them up in newspaper. Don’t put them in a plastic bag, because this may ruin the evidence. If possible, take along clean clothes.Support– A friend or a loved one that you trust can provide you with support.  Lay a charge – Lay a charge at the police station once you are up to it. If the survivor is a child or a person with a mental impairment, a case must by law be opened with the police. There is no time limit on when you can lay a charge.Get counselling – Counselling should be offered at the health facility. If this does not happen, contact the Gender-Based-Violence Command Centre to talk to someone about your ordeal. Care CentreYou can also seek help at a Thuthuzela Care Centre. These are one-stop facilities for survivors of sexual assaults. They provide a place of comfort for survivors and give them access to medical professionals, skilled prosecutors, social workers, magistrates and the police. Services are free of charge.
