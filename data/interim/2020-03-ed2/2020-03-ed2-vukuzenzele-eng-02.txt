5 Vuk’uzenzelePatient support crucial for fighting TBDale HesThe USAID Tubercu-losis South Africa Project is proving to be a perfect example of how government, com-munities and NGOs can partner together to combat tuberculosis (TB) by pro-viding proper support to patients.
 South Africa has taken a position of leadership in the global fight against TB, and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has stepped in to provide assistance. The five-year project, which started in 2016, is being car-ried out in partnership with the National Department of Health in eight of South Africa’s provinces. One of the most important parts of the project is to support community-based NGOs. The project provides funding to 21 NGOs who have supported more than 3 500 patients, the majority based in rural areas. Free State progressBased in Mangaung, Mosa-moria is one of the NGOs which has received funding from the project. The organi-sation has a team of commu-nity health workers, a project manager and a data capturer who all work towards en-suring that patients stay on treatment so that they can be cured in a six month period. “We employ 74 care givers for this project. Initially we worked with 200 patients, then 400 patients, and in our current contract we have 500 patients who we work with on a daily basis. The patients are referred to us when they have been diagnosed as having TB from nine differ-ent clinics in the Mangaung Metro,” says Mosamaria coordinator Trudie Harrison. Mosamaria conducts monthly door-to-door screening campaigns to find new TB patients and get them on treatment immediately.Harrison says that Mosa-moria’s work has reduced the stigma around TB, built close relationships with the community and also led to much better rates of success-ful treatment.“For example, in 2018, 514 of our patients were cured,” Harrison says. Harrison shares the story of one of Mosamaria’s patients. He was given daily support by a Mosamaria caregiver, who ensured that he swal-lowed his tablets every day and also assisted with maize meal and new clothes. “He completed the treat-ment and was cured. He went back to work as his employer had kept his job for him,” says Harrison.Know the symptoms of TB If you have some of the fol-lowing symptoms, then you should visit your nearest clinic or hospital to be tested for TB:
• Coughing that lasts three or more weeks; 
• Coughing up blood; 
• Chest pain, or pain when breathing or coughing;

All you need to know about hearing lossAllison CooperWhen you strug-gle to hear, your ability to com-municate effectively is com-promised and it can become difficult to enjoy taking part in daily activities such as outings with friends, busi-ness meetings, talking on the phone or listening to the television at normal level.
According to the South Afri-can National Deaf Association, hearing loss exists when there is diminished sensitivity to the sounds normally heard. Hearing impairments are categorised by:
• their type, severity and the age of onset (before or after language is acquired), and can exist in only one ear or both ears.  can occur in the outer or mid-dle ear (conductive hearing loss) or in the inner ear (sen-sory-neural hearing loss), or both (mixed hearing loss). In the outer and middle ear, typical problems include too much earwax, infection of the auditory canal or in-fection of the eardrum, or otosclerosis, which is the abnormal growth of bone. In the inner ear, the major-ity of hearing problems re-sult from damaged inner ear structures caused by aging, excessive exposure to loud noise, injury, illness and cer-tain medications.Hearing loss can range in se-verity from mild to profound and can be temporary or per-manent. A person with mild hearing loss is unable to hear soft sounds and has difficulty un-derstanding speech in noisy environments; with moderate hearing loss, they are unable to hear soft and moderately loud sounds and have consid-erable difficulty understand-ing speech, particularly with background noise; with severe hearing loss, they are unable to hear most sounds; and with profound hearing loss, some very loud sounds are audible but communication without a hearing instrument is difficult.
Signs of hearing lossIn adults, hearing loss can de-velop gradually over several years. When this happens, most people are not aware of it until family or friends bring it to their attention. Risk factors for hearing loss, that should be evaluated by an audiologist, include; 
• trouble under-standing people; • dizziness or a bal-ance problem; • ringing in the ears (tinni-tus); • muffled or plugged ears; • ear or head trauma and a family history of hearing loss.Signs of hearing loss  in children:
• not being startled by loud sounds; 
•  can´t locate the sour ce of sounds; • often touching or pulling on one or both ears; • stop babbling or make  more high-pitched scream-ing sounds at six to eight months; 
• need louder sound levels to function;  often misunderstand spoken directions; • not responding when called; 
• withdrawing from social contact.

If you suspect that you could be suffering from hearing loss, visit your nearest clinic or an audiologist.This informations was supplied by the South African National  Deaf Association  (www.sanda.org.za)March 2020 Edition 2
