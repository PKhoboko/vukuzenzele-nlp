All you need to know about hearing lossAllison CooperWhen you strug gle to hear, your ability to com municate effectively is com promised and it can become difficult to enjoy taking part in daily activities such as outings with friends, busi ness meetings, talking on the phone or listening to the television at normal level.
According to the South Afri can National Deaf Association, hearing loss exists when there is diminished sensitivity to the sounds normally heard.
Hearing impairments are categorised by:
• their type, severity and the age of onset (before or after language is acquired), and can exist in only one ear or both ears.  can occur in the outer or mid dle ear (conductive hearing loss) or in the inner ear (sen sory-neural hearing loss), or both (mixed hearing loss).
 In the outer and middle ear, typical problems include too much earwax, infection of the auditory canal or in fection of the eardrum, or otosclerosis, which is the abnormal growth of bone.
 In the inner ear, the major ity of hearing problems re sult from damaged inner ear structures caused by aging, excessive exposure to loud noise, injury, illness and cer tain medications.
Hearing loss can range in se verity from mild to profound and can be temporary or per manent.
A person with mild hearing loss is unable to hear soft sounds and has difficulty un derstanding speech in noisy environments; with moderate hearing loss, they are unable to hear soft and moderately loud sounds and have consid erable difficulty understand ing speech, particularly with background noise; with severe hearing loss, they are unable to hear most sounds; and with profound hearing loss, some very loud sounds are audible but communication without a hearing instrument is difficult.
Signs of hearing lossIn adults, hearing loss can de velop gradually over several years. When this happens, most people are not aware of it until family or friends bring it to their attention.
Risk factors for hearing loss, that should be evaluated by an audiologist, include; 
• trouble under standing people; • dizziness or a bal ance problem; • ringing in the ears (tinni tus); • muffled or plugged ears; • ear or head trauma and a family history of hearing loss.
Signs of hearing loss in chil dren:
• not being startled by loud sounds; 
•  can´t locate the source of sounds; • often touching or pulling on one or both ears; • stop babbling or make more high-pitched scream ing sounds at six to eight months; 
• need louder sound levels to function; • often misunderstand spoken directions; • not responding when called; 
• withdrawing from social contact. 

If you suspect that you could be suffering from hearing loss, visit your nearest clinic or an audiologist.This informations was supplied by the South  African National  Deaf Association  (www.sanda.org.za)Indlovulenkhulu 2020 Lushicilelo 2
