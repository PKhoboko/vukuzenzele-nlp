5Vuk’uzenzele November  2020 Edition 1 GENERALGENDER-BASED VIOLENCE Avoid becoming a human trafficking victimSilusapho NyandaAs the number of human trafficking cases being reported increases, it is important that you take steps to ensure your safety.
To avoid becoming a victim of trafficking, you should avoid travelling alone at night or on deserted streets.It is important that you are aware of your surroundings at all times. Being alert will help spot something that is out of place. If you notice a person or a car following you, find a crowded place and contact the police or someone you trust immediately.Traffickers often use the promise of a job to kidnap their victims and will approach potential victims offering them a job or some kind of opportunity. This form of trafficking can happen anywhere – even on social media, at school, in the mall and outside your house.Make sure you conduct thorough research on potential employers before going to meet them in person for interviews. This can be done by verifying that the company really exists by checking with the Companies and Intellectual Property Commission. You should also tell some one you trust when you are going to an interview and arrange for them to call you after a certain amount of time. If possible, have someone go with you.  Be careful when using social media, especially when a stranger offers to help, offers money, a place to stay or a job opportunity in response to something you posted.If you are going out to meet someone new, do so at a public place and let someone you trust know where you are.When going out with children, keep them close and make sure you can see them at all times.You should never send a child on an errand without a trusted adult to watch over them. Get into the habit of checking in on your children regularly, so you know where they are.

The NGO has counsellors and social workers perma-nently located at schools in Cape Town and the Cape Winelands. The team of pro-fessionals assist pupils who have been victims of violence at home or in their local com-munities.The NGO’s Chief Executive Officer Gerrit Taning says they treat pupils with dif-ferent traumatic experiences through group and individu-al sessions. “We work in disadvantaged communities where violence is prevalent. We help children who have experienced ad-verse childhood experiences such as abuse, loss, poverty and other challenges that are faced by children,” says Taning.One of the key topics the NGO seeks to address during sessions with the pupils is the belief that 'men don't cry'. The organisation aims to teach young boys to be in tune with their feelings and emotions. This will encourage young boys to talk about their feel-ings and experiences.Taning says that trauma can cause behavioural problems in children.“When there is a cycle of traumatic experiences that builds up, it often affects children negatively. A qui-et child will start lashing out and engaging in risky behaviour. A child that was outgoing suddenly becomes withdrawn. Some pupils go from the brightest students to not being able to keep up with their peers.”He says that trauma can be dealt with, but it requires proactive teaching of children before the cycle is repeated.
