Vuk’uzenzeleEMINYE IMIBA GABALALAKUKHO  IZINTO ezahlukileyo abemi boMzantsi Afrika abanokuzenza ukonga umbane futhi bakuphephe ukucinywa kombane. Masonge umbane ukuze ungacimi  Silusapho NyandaIbambela-Mlawuli weSitishi kwiSikhululo soMbane sa kwa-Eskom i-Matimba u-Obakeng Mabotja uthi ukunqongophala kwamandla ombane owane leyo eMzantsi Afrika kuchaphazela iimpilo zabantu kuba imisebenzi yemihla ngemihla  ayenzeki ngexesha lokucima kombane.
ISikhululo saMandla oMbane iMatimba siseLephalale, eLimpopo.UMabotja uyachaza ukuba ukucima kombane kwenzeka xa u-Eskom engakwazi ukuvelisa umbane owaneleyo uku-ba ujongane neemfuno zelizwe. Ngoko ke kubalulekile, utsho, ukuba bonke abemi boMzantsi Afrika badlale indima ekuse-benziseni umbane omncinci.Iingcebiso ezivela ku-Es-kom zokusebenzisa umbane  omncinci: • Cima izibane xa uphuma egumbini• Sebenzisa iibhaluphu ze-LED• Cima zonke izinto ezisebe
nzisa umbane xa zingasebenzi• Sebenzisa amanzi abandayo kuphela, ngaphandle kokuba kukho imfuneko• Sebenzisa ingubo yobushushu ukugquma igiza  yakho.
Ziliqela izinto ezinokuthi ziphazamise ukuveliswa kwa-mandla, kuquka ukulondolozwa, ukuvalwa okungacwangciswanga futhi, ngokucaci-leyo, imozulu.UMabotja uthi isikhululo sakhe, ingakumbi, siyachaphazeleka ngamaqondo  obushushu aphezulu. “Ngeentsuku ezishushu kakhulu, isikhululo asikwazi ukuvelisa amandla ngokupheleleyo,” utsho.ISikhululo saMandla oMbane iMatimba sisebenzisa amalahle ukuvelisa umbane, kwaye senzelwe ukuvelisa ama-3990 MW.“Amandla asasazwa ngoku-fakwa endaweni yokuhambisa. Ahamba ngemigca yokuhambisa umbane ophezulu kwaye adlula kwisiguquli esehlayo ukuthoba amandla ombane. Umbane usasazelwa kwigridi yesizwe.”Amalahle esikhululo samandla avela kwimayini i-Exxa-ro’s Grootegeluk. Ahanjiswa ngebhanti aye koovimba ne-zisele zaseMatimba, ngaphambi kokuba aye kumatye okusila apho asilwa aze ajikwe abe ngumbane, utsho uMabotja.
Ngezinye iingcebiso zokuba ungawonga njani umbane, ngena kwiwe bhusayithi yakwa-Es kom: www.eskom.co.za Isikhululo soMbane iMatimba esiseLimpopo sidlala indima ebaluleke kakhulu ekuveliseni umbane eMzantsi Afrika.
A MPUMALANGA emerging farmer is ploughing ahead, having already won a prestigious award and secured a substantial contract for her maize.Silusapho NyandaA young female  maize farmer is taking giant leaps towards becoming a successful commercial farmer.Njabulo Mbokane (24), the owner of a 200-hectare non-genetically modified organism yellow maize farm, was recently named the South African Breweries (SAB) and FarmSol Young Emerging Farmer of the Year.
