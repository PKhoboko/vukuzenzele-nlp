Vuk’uzenzeleOKUQUKETHWEZININGI KAKHULU  izinto izakhamizi saseNingizimu Afrika ezingazenza ukonga ugesi ukuze kugweny-we ukucishwa ku-kagesi ngenhloso yokuwonga.Ukukhanyiswa nokucishwa kukagesiSilusapho NyandaIbamba Lomphathi  Wesiteshi sokuphehla ugesi e-Matimba Power Station u-Obakeng Mabotja uthi ukushoda kwamandla kagesi anele eNingizimu Afrika kuno mthelela omubi kakhulu ezimpilweni zabantu nje ngoba imisebenzi evamile njengokupheka nokuqhuba amabhizinisi kungenzeke ime ugesi uvaliwe.Isiteshi sokuphehla ugesi esaziwa nge-Matimba Power Station sitholakala endaweni yaseLephalale, eLimpopo.U-Mabotja uchaze wathi ukucishwa kukagesi ngenhloso yokuwonga kwenzeka lapho inkampani i-Eskom yehluleka ukuphehla ugesi owanele ukuhlangabezana nezidingongqangi zikagesi kuleli zwe. Ngalokho-ke, uye wathi, kubalulekile ukuthi  zonke izakhamizi zaseNiningizimu Afrika zenze konke  okuse-mandleni ukuwonga ugesi.Amacebo eza nenkampani i-Eskom okusebenzisa ugesi kancane:
• Cisha ugesi uma uphuma endlini• Sebenzisa amagulobhu ase-benzisa ugesi kancane nabi-zwa ngama-LED bulbs• Cisha zonke izinto eziseben-za ngogesi uma ungazise-benzisi• Vama ukusebenzisa amanzi abandayo, ungasebenzisa nashisayo uma kunesidin-go• Mboza igiza yakho ngezingubo ezibamba uku-shisa.Ziningi izinto ezingaphaza-misa ukuphehlwa kukagesi, lokhu kungabandakanya ukuvuselelwa kwezakhiwo zikagesi, ukucima kukagesi okungahleliwe kanye, nokuba-luleke kakhulu, nesimo sezulu. UMobatja uthi isiphehli-mandla sakhe sikagesi, sith-ikanyezwe kakhulu wukushisa kwesimo sezulu. “Ezinsukwini ezishisa kakhu-lu, isiteshi sokuphehla ugesi si-yehluleka ukuphehla amandla ngendlela okufanele siphehle ngayo,” kusho yena. Isiteshi sokuphehla ugesi esaziwa ngeMatimba Power Station nokuyisiteshi esise-benzisa amalahle ukuphehla ugesi, sakhelwa ukuba sikwa-zi ukuphehla amandla kagesi alinganiselwa ku-3999 MW. “Ukuphakelwa kwamandla kagesi kwenziwa ngokuse-benzisana nezinye iziteshi ezincane. Ugesi lo uyaye uhambe ngezintambo nomlilo  emikhulu bese uhambe njalo uze ufinyelele ezintanjeni nom-lilo omncane. Emva kwalokhoUgesi uyaye uthunyelwe eziteshini ezinkulu jikelele.”Amalahle asetshenziswa eziteshini zokuphehlwa kukagesi aqhamuka ezimayini zase-Exxaro's Grootegeluk.  Uyaye uthunyelwe emibhosho-ngweni nasemagunjini okugci-na ugesi, ngaphambi kokuba aye ezindaweni zokuphehla ugesi lapho afike aphendulwe khona ugesi, kusho  U-Mobatja . vNgokuthola ulwazi oluthe thuthu ngamacebo okongiwa kukagesi, ungavakashela kule webhusayithi:  www.eskom.co.za Isiphehlimandla i-Matimba Power station esiseLimpopo sidlala indima esemqoka ekukhiqizeni ugesi eNingizimu Afrika.
A MPUMALANGA emerging farmer is ploughing ahead, having already won a prestigious award and secured a substantial contract for her maize.Silusapho NyandaA young female  maize farmer is taking giant leaps towards becoming a successful commercial farmer.Njabulo Mbokane (24), the owner of a 200-hectare non-genetically modified organism yellow maize farm, was recently named the South African Breweries (SAB) and FarmSol Young Emerging Farmer of the Year.
