Xitichi xa Gezi xa Matimba xi kumeka eLephalale, Limpopo. Mabotja u hlamusele leswaku ku timeka ka gezi swi humelela loko Eskom yi tsandzeka ku endla gezi ro enela ku fikelela swilaveko swa tiko. Hiko kwalaho, u vule leswaku i swa nkoka swonghasi leswaku maAfrika-Dzonga hinkwavo va tirha xiphemu xa vona hi ku tirhisa gezi ritsongo. Switsundzuxo swa Eskom swo tirhisa gezi ritsongo:
• Tima timboni loko u suka ekamareni•  Tirhisa tindhlulupu ta LED• Tima switirhisiwa swa gezi loko u nga ri eku swi tirhiseni• Tirhisa mati yo titimela ntsena, handle ka loko swi fanerile • Tirhisa nkumba wa rihiso ku funengeta gizara ya wena.Swiphemu swo tala swi nga kavanyeta ku endliwa ka gezi, ku katsa na vuhlayisi, ku timeka ka gezi loku nga kunguhateriwangiki, kasi xa nkoka swonghasi, maxelo. Mabotja u vule leswaku pulanti ya yena, ngopfungo pfu, ya khumbeka hi max elo yo hisa swinene. “Hi masiku ya mumu lowukulu, xitichi a xi swi koti ku endla gezi hi matimba  hinkwawo ya xona,” a vula.  Xitichi xa Gezi xa Matimba xi tirhisa malahla ku endla gezi, naswona xi endleriwile ku endla 3990 MW. “Gezi ri hangalasiwa hi ku tirhisa xitichitsongo xa vuhangalasi. Ri famba hi tinta mbhu to hundzisa ta nsus umeto wa le henhla kutani ri hundza hi le ka swihu ngatandzilo swa mpimo wa le hansi leswi swi tirhaka ku hunguta nsusumeto. Kutani gezi leri ri hu ndziseriwa eka tintambhu ta gezi ta rixaka.” Malahla ya xitichi lexa gezi ya huma emugodini wa Grootegeluk wa Exxaro. Malahla lawa ya tleketliwa hi ku tirhisa bandhi ro hundzisa ya yisiwa emadulwini na le tiyinkhweni ta Matimba, ya nga si yisiwa eswigaywini laha ya siriwaka na ku hundzuriwa ya va gezi, ku vula Mabotja.
