Vuk’uzenzeleLOKUVAMILEKUNETINTFO LETINYENTI LETEHLUKE-NE bantfu baseNingizimu Afrika labangatenta konga gezi futsi ngalokoke bavikele bucimicimi bagezi (kusebentisa gezi ngekwabelana).Kukhanyiswa NekucinywaSilusapho NyandaLibamba leMphatsisite shi se-Eskom iMa timba Power Station Obakeng Mabotja utsite kuswelakala kwemandla lafanelekile eNingizimu Afrika kunemtselela etimphilweni tebantfu ngenca yekutsi imisebenti leyetayelekile  ayenteki ngesikhatsi sekwabelana ngagezi.
IMatimba Power Station iseLephalale, eLimpopo.
 Mabotja uchaze watsi kwa belana ngagezi kwenteka uma i-Eskom ihluleka kukhicita gezi lowanele lotawuhambisana netidzingo talelive. Ngako-ke  kumcoka, kutsi bonkhe bantfu baseNingizimu Afrika badlale tindzima tabo kute basebetise gezi lomncane.Emathiphu labuya ku-Eskom ekusebentisa gezi kancane:
• Cima emalumbu uma uphuma egunjini lelitsite.• Sebentisa emaglobhu e-LED• Cima ema-apulayensi(tintfo letisebentisa gezi) uma ungawasebentisi.• Sebentisa emanti labandzako kuphela, ngaphandle kwalapho kunesidzingo  salashisako.• Sebentisa ingubo yekufu tfumeta kubhonya igiza yakho.Tintfo letimbalwa tingaphatamisa kukhicitwa kwagezi, letifaka ekhatsi kunakekelwa, kuvalwa lokungakahlelwa futsi uma kuhlolisiswa, nesimo selitulu.Mabotja utsite siphehligezi sakhe, ikakhulu, sitsintfwa ngemazinga lasetulu esimo selitulu.“Uma kushisa kakhulu, lesiteshi siyehluleka kukhicita gezi ngemandla aso laphelele, kwasho yena. IMatimba Power Station isebentisa emalahle kukhicita gezi, futsi sidizayinwe kutsi sikhicite gezi lo-3990 MW. “Gezi usabalaliswa ngekusebentisa siteshi lesincane. Uhamba ngemandla evolitheji yetintsambo tekusabalalisa bese undlula kuthransifoma yekuwunciphisa emandla abe yivolitheji lencane. Gezi-ke ubese utfunyelwa kugridi yavelonkhe.”Emalahle alesitishi abuya emayini i-Exxaro’s Grootegeluk. Uhanjiswa ngendlela yelibhandi uye kusilulu  iMatimba nasendzaweni yekubeka emalahle, ngembi kwekuya kumshini wekuwagaya lapho agaywa khona bese aguculwa aba ngugezi, kwasho Mabotja.
 vKute utfole lamanye emathiphu ekonga gezi, vakashela iwebhusayithi ye-Eskom:  www.eskom.co.za Siphehligezi saseMatimba eLimpopo  sidlala indzima lebaluleke kakhulu ekuphehleni gezi lapha eNingizimu Afrika.
A MPUMALANGA emerging farmer is ploughing ahead, having already won a prestigious award and secured a substantial contract for her maize.Silusapho NyandaA young female  maize farmer is taking giant leaps towards becoming a successful commercial farmer.Njabulo Mbokane (24), the owner of a 200-hectare non-genetically modified organism yellow maize farm, was recently named the South African Breweries (SAB) and FarmSol Young Emerging Farmer of the Year.
