August 2020 Edition 2CORONAVIRUSUPDATECORONAVIRUSUPDATEPregnancy does not increase COVID-19 risksSOME GOOD news for moms-to-be is that their pregnancy will not make them more ill should they contract COVID-19 and they may still breastfeed.
Silusapho NyandaPregnant wom en and unborn children are not at a greater risk of contracting or developing severe symptoms of the coronavirus (COVID-19) but should still exercise good hygiene and social distancing.
The majority of pregnant women who contract COV-ID-19 will only show mild to moderate symptoms of the virus. However, pregnancy changes the immune system so pregnant women should continue with standard pre-cautionary measures. Bongumusa Makhathini, a specialist obstetrician and gynaecologist at Grey’s Hos-pital in Pietermaritzburg, KwaZulu-Natal, says that tests done on the placenta and umbilical cord blood of COVID-19-positive mothers were all negative for the virus.“The available data shows that during pregnancy and birth, women infected by COVID-19 are not worse compared to non-pregnant women,” he says.Children born to COVID-19-positive mothers may be breastfed, provided the mother follows the right hygiene routine, including washing her hands before and after holding her child, sanitising her chest before breastfeeding and wearing a mask. Mothers must clean any surface before a child comes into contact with it.As breastfeeding offers more benefits than the risks posed by COVID-19, new mothers are encouraged to exclusively breastfeed for the first six months of a child’s life. Dr Makhathini says tests have found that COVID-19 is not present in breast milk.“However, breast hygiene and other general COVID-19 safety precautions should be taken during breastfeeding or breast milk expression to avoid droplets and skin contact infections to the newborn,” he says.Chronic diseases like asthma, diabetes and high blood pressure are known to increase the risk of severe symptoms of COVID-19 in the general population, and this applies to preg nant women too, says Dr Makhathini.Dr Makhathini says that pregnant women who have COVID-19 and any other of these chronic diseases, must keep a close eye on their health and their unborn baby.“Closer monitoring of ma-ternal and fetal wellbeing is highly recommended,” he says.He adds that pregnancy complications such as a mis-carriage or going into labour earlier than planned have not been directly linked to the COVID-19 virus.
Back to work after Covid-19 a full guideAllison CooperWhen can you return to work if you have tested positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19)? The National Institute for Communicable Diseases has the answers you need.
When I test positive for COVID-19, how long do I have to stay in isolation?People who test positive for COVID-19, but don’t have any symptoms, must remain in isolation at home or in a government isolation facili-ty for 10 days, from the day they receive their positive test result.Those who have mild symp-toms must remain in isolation at home or in a government isolation facility for 10 days, from the day their symptoms start.Those who have severe disease, who have to go to hospital, must remain in iso-lation for 10 days, from when they are stable and don’t need oxygen anymore.How can a COVID-19 positive people transfer the disease to others?According to Health Min-ister Zweli Mkhize, most people who have a mild infection can spread the virus for between seven to 12 days. However, people who become very sick could be infectious and be able to transmit the virus to others for a longer period of time.Do I have to have anoth-er COVID-19 test, proving that I am negative, before I return to work?No. Re-testing people who have experienced mild illness and have recovered is not recommended. A person is considered safe to return to work and come out of isolation if they are no longer infectious. This means they developed their first symptoms more than 10 days ago and have not had any symptoms for at least three days.In most cases, employees can return to work without testing again if:
• They have completed 10 days of mandatory quarantine or self-isolation.• Those who had moderate or severe symptoms undergo a medical evaluation.• They continue to practice personal hygiene and social distancing.• The employer monitors the worker to ensure they do not regress.• They wear a mask, from the date of diagnosis for at least 21 days.
I have tested negative but I still have symptoms. What now?It is possible to get a false negative test result. This means that your first test could be negative, but you could test positive at a later stage. If you continue to have COVID-19 symptoms contact your healthcare professional.What if I am still show-ing symptoms after 10 days?It is common for patients to continue to have symptoms for longer than 10 days. Full recovery may take several weeks. If you still have symp-toms, seek advice from your healthcare professional.For more information about COVID-19, visit the National Institute for Communicable Diseases’ website at www.nicd.ac.za, the COVID-19 free website at coronavirus.datafree.co, call the COVID-19 Hotline Number at 0800 029 999 or send a WhatsApp to  0600 12 3456.
